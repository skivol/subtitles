1
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,500
Despite our best efforts

2
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:17,430
we would be somehow accused,
wrongly accused, of misinformation

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,030
and

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,130
I just said, you know, this can't be controversial we're
talking about prednisone, when we use that for asthma

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,910
Now, we're talking about lovenox we
use that for blood clotting and aspirin.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,730
I was trying to defuse all this incredible
focus on hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,850
and I think what was really a low
blow in terms of unprofessionalism

8
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,550
he called us snake oil salesmen

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,320
and can you imagine that's from a
junior physician? He doesn't have a major

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,670
contribution to his name.

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,550
Why would the head of a health department
or the head of the NIH or why would the CDC

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,580
keep me from taking a
product if it works and then

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,380
if they tell me
the vaccine works

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,720
certainly it must work if
they tell me it's safe save

15
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,880
it must be safe but what we don't realize
is really what's behind the scenes of how

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
all the decisions

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,720
have been made and that's
been the journey that I've been on.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,690
I really didn't know that
they never do these studies.

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,710
I didn't know that every study on
safety that we are being told about

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,140
is being done by
the manufacturer

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,930
that's going to make billions
of dollars from the product

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,090
and that the FDA and CDC

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,160
basically just take
their word for it.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
You can't take

25
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,460
what's normally a decade long process
for developing a product and ensuring its

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,300
safety and efficacy and
compressing it into six to nine months

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,580
and not cut some
corners. That's just absurd.

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,320
Yet that's what we were told they were doing.
We have the hyper inflammatory response

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,060
that happens in a
subset of patients

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,090
and that's the one that really
puts you in the hospital and kills you

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,780
and the good news
is there's a bunch of

32
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,920
anti inflammatory drugs that
can be used for the second phase.

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,670
Uncovering
Lies & Deception

34
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:01,373
Reactions
Damages & Deaths

35
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:06,276
Truth or
Propaganda

36
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:10,854
Censorship
Voices Silenced

37
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:15,233
Government
Going Too Far

38
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:19,296
Money over
Safety

39
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:22,949
True Agenda
Being Revealed

40
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:29,062
Covid Revealed

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,640
Hello and welcome to episode one

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,050
of Covid Revealed.

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,120
Over the years revealed films has done
several docu series on a variety of topics

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,650
and I can tell you
without reservation

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,350
this is the most important
documentary series

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,300
that we have ever created. Why?

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,990
Because Covid is the biggest
subject in the world today

48
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,310
and it's literally changing the world
as we know it and not for the better.

49
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,410
What's going on in the way of information
that is being put through social media

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,070
platforms

51
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,450
in the mainstream media

52
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,880
is really not so
much information

53
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,500
it's more propaganda

54
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,350
and people who
are credible experts

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,960
with extraordinary
backgrounds and experience

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,320
when they voice their concerns
about what's being done right now

57
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,530
they're being silenced, they're
being canceled, they're being censored

58
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,870
we needed to give them a platform, we wanted
to get all of these experts in one place

59
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,710
so when people say I am trying
to figure out this Covid thing

60
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,460
it's complex that are so
many facets to it where do I go

61
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,630
we wanted one place to go and
it's right here in Covid Revealed.

62
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,280
Also wanted to communicate

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,710
that the people who
sat for these interviews

64
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,720
are extraordinarily courageous

65
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,640
and heroic human beings

66
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,970
they know the heat that they're
going to take for speaking up

67
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,750
in the way that they are in today's
world but their conscience demanded it

68
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,960
when it comes to Covid there's
many facets it's not as simple as

69
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,660
just the vaccine that's
certainly a big part of it

70
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,480
and there's many sub
issues under the vaccine

71
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,880
good for children not
good for children for adults

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,840
which vaccine

73
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,310
boosters, should it be mandatory, should be
mandated, is it really approved is it not

74
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,500
approved, there's so
many issues here

75
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,440
that you need to understand
when it comes to the vaccine

76
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,500
then we cover it and we
cover it in great depth

77
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,010
I think by the time you're done
watching this series you're going to see

78
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,590
that you're about as expert
as anybody else out there

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,170
on this vaccine issue
but it doesn't stop there

80
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,160
what about quarantines what about early
treatments what about things like ivermectin

81
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,300
and hydroxychloroquine

82
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,250
do they really work,
do they not work

83
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,220
what about the other hospital
protocols, what are we missing

84
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,040
are there things that we could
be doing that we're not doing

85
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,330
that would help us should we be infected,
what about masks, do masks really work, should

86
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,100
we be sending our
kids to school in masks.

87
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,270
Is there any data on this? Is there any expert
that could speak to this in authoritative

88
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,040
way? The answer to all of
these questions is yes,

89
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,810
there's people
who are authorities

90
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,440
who know this material, have great
command of it, who can speak to it

91
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,470
in a very very focused

92
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,210
passionate and truthful way

93
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,860
and that's what we're delivering
here over the span of this docu series.

94
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
I need your help.

95
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,870
We are cancelled off of all
social media, there's no way

96
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,190
that we can go out there

97
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,050
and in a social or mass way let people know
about this series and the fact that they

98
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,590
could sign up to watch it
for free the entire series.

99
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,720
So here's what I'm
going to ask you to do.

100
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,530
Let's go old school direct
communication peer to peer.

101
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,770
Take the people that you
know, love and care about

102
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,450
and send them a link let them come and
let them register and let them share with

103
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,450
other people also.

104
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,250
That's the only way people
can gain access this information.

105
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,630
Some pretty dark powers have
grabbed control of all the media

106
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,820
and are shutting down anything

107
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,600
that isn't a part of the party line
that they want people to know

108
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,240
and any dissenting
opinions or information

109
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,800
is automatically shut out

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,580
but we won't be deterred we had to build
the firewalls we had to get our own video

111
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,220
host and we had to do all
the things that we could do

112
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,340
so we can get this information
out and not be shut down

113
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,030
and I'm going to ask you to help
me with that so before we jump in

114
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,850
if you would just
please answer the call

115
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,200
it's very simple

116
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,610
to take an action

117
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,350
to share this information, to send people
the link so they can jump in and participate

118
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,530
and get this information
through the free viewing period.

119
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,270
I know one thing for a fact

120
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,080
the information that we're going to be
presenting during the course of these docu series

121
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,850
is going to be minimally

122
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,140
life changing

123
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,510
and in many instances
might even be

124
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,010
life saving.

125
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,200
This is about as
important as it gets.

126
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,350
We've done our job we've
put together this information

127
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,260
I'm excited to take this
journey with you and please

128
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,940
help us share it
with other people.

129
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,290
So thank you for being here,
thank you for your trust in us

130
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,720
and now let's jump
into episode one.

131
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,320
When it comes to
a career in medicine

132
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,050
Doctor Peter
McCullough is a giant.

133
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,300
His background, experience in so
many aspects of academic medicine,

134
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,910
practicing medicine, research
and publication. It goes on and on.

135
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,270
He's eminently
qualified to be speaking

136
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,070
to the Covid issue today

137
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,380
and what's extraordinary to me

138
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,280
is that now that he's speaking
truth when it comes to Covid

139
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,970
people are trying to attack
him and attack his credibility

140
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,960
but it's nearly impossible to do
at least to do with a straight face

141
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,380
because this man has
incredible achievements

142
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,260
not only is he the great
doctor, he's a great human being.

143
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,200
He is not going to be deterred,
he's going to speak the truth.

144
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,180
He's going to share
what he knows

145
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,470
and he cares about this world he
cares about about you he cares about me

146
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,200
and he cares about
what's going on right now.

147
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,550
My conversation with him
was pretty encompassing meeting.

148
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,420
We covered a lot of ground so
there are three parts to this interview.

149
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,976
This is part one of my three part
interview with dr Peter McCullough.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,260
Let's jump right in.

151
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,180
Doctor McCullough thanks so
much for taking the time here.

152
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,880
Let's just start with your [...] background.
You have a pretty incredible resume when

153
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,780
it comes to your academic achievements etc and
I'd like to get into some detail around that.

154
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,600
Can we just start with what caused
you wanting to become a medical doctor?

155
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,870
- As a kid,

156
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,180
I always wanted to be a doctor [...] it's
always seemed like I was born to do it I love

157
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,500
the idea of science

158
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,890
and applying

159
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,590
science to helping people.

160
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,600
And I attended undergraduate
at Baylor University in Texas.

161
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,310
And from there I went onto university of
Texas southwestern medical school in Dallas.

162
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,464
I finished the Alpha omega Alpha.
- What does that mean?

163
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:48,480
That means the top
five to ten percent of

164
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,621
the graduating medical class in the
top fifty percent of medical schools in

165
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:53,738
the United States.

166
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,670
I went on from there to the
University of Washington in Seattle.

167
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,850
Which at the time was the
top ranked internal medicine

168
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,150
program in the United States and I
trained in internal medicine there.

169
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,770
Of interest at

170
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,640
during my time at southwestern University
of Washington in Seattle the nobel prize

171
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,050
was awarded in medicine.

172
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:10,590
- Wow.

173
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
- Tremendous times.

174
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,470
From there as it was common
back in the time many of my

175
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,710
fellow graduates from Seattle became CDC
officers or did service, I did service and

176
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,130
joined a Rural Health
Initiative in Northern Michigan.

177
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,800
In return for that I
was relieved of my

178
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,070
student loans.

179
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,684
I went on to University of
Michigan and received

180
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,286
my master's in public
health in epidemiology

181
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,350
University of Michigan is
considered in the top

182
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:40,470
of four schools of public health
the United States and of note

183
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,100
I had a large role in the
development of the polio vaccine historically.

184
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,200
- Really? Wow!

185
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,240
- And from there I went on

186
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,100
for my cardiology training in clinical
cardiology at which that what is now

187
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,200
the Oakland University
William Beaumont

188
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,430
School of Medicine.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,170
And trained under an iconic
leader there doctor William O'Neill.

190
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,780
Who really is credited with these considered
the father of modern interventional

191
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,620
cardiology so

192
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,502
today patients have their arteries

193
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:10,536
opened up

194
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:12,806
using a catheter and stunting

195
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,941
in the setting of a heart attack and that's
really all originated from that group at Beaumont.

196
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:20,306
Those were very exciting
times there I got introduced to

197
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:23,946
publishing in the best journals including
the New England Journal of Medicine

198
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:27,446
and incredible times
of scientific innovation

199
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,966
addressing a
problem - Heart attack

200
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:35,006
which it was a giant issue in the United
States and with the progress that we made

201
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:36,176
was extraordinary.

202
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:38,126
From there I went on and

203
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:42,386
I took a staff position at Henry Ford
hospital, one of the oldest hospitals

204
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:46,286
in southeast Michigan, became the
program director there in cardiology.

205
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:51,156
I moved on to become the chief of cardiology
at the University of Missouri in Kansas City.

206
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:52,706
And held that post

207
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:56,516
for a few years and based on family reasons
and other reasons return to southeast

208
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:59,906
Michigan was a division chief
at William Beaumont hospital.

209
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:04,136
During it's ascension to to the point
where it became a medical school.

210
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:10,196
And was honored to become the
chief academic and scientific officer for

211
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,206
the St. John Providence
Health System

212
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:18,116
which is [...] first, the largest
Catholic health ministry of

213
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,596
the ascension health overall.

214
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:25,076
- What are the responsibilities if you're
the chief medical and academic officer?

215
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:30,446
- In that role I oversaw the chief medical
officers of the CMOs for the hospitals as

216
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:31,826
well as the hospital presidents.

217
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:36,026
Along the lines of medical
education and research.

218
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:39,852
We had a very large graduate
medical education and actually

219
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:41,876
undergraduate medical
education program there.

220
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:45,236
As well as multiple
research centers.

221
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,206
I maintain a clinical practice
through all that so I've always

222
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:51,876
maintained my board
certifications in cardiology.

223
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,196
And as well as internal medicine
so I maintain my broad base

224
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:59,726
I always attended on the impatient teaching
services for both medicine and cardiology.

225
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:04,706
And maintained a non-invasive
cardiology internal medicine practice.

226
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:09,386
And in the last decade
I was recruited to

227
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:12,236
Baylor University Medical
Center in Dallas Texas.

228
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:17,936
Where I headed up the cardiology
program I was the program director there.

229
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:22,736
I was delighted to,
I mean, honored to

230
00:12:22,946 --> 00:12:25,742
be a vice chair of medicine. I served
doctor Michael Emmett there,

231
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:29,516
the current chief of medicine, iconic
leaders there including John Fordtran

232
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:32,276
ahead of Michael Emmett
and I was introduced to them

233
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:36,235
when I was a medical student at
southwestern back in 1986 where I

234
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:42,176
rotated at Baylor and what a terrific place
to be, incredibly honored to be there.

235
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:44,876
And I served that
role for many years

236
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:49,706
and officed with doctor William
Roberts who's a venerable,

237
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:54,866
iconic medical editor, is editor in chief of
the American journal of cardiology one of

238
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:58,026
the longest standing
editorships in the United States.

239
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:04,556
Under him I was honored to be
the senior associate editor of a JC.

240
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:07,406
I also took on
other editorships.

241
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:12,026
I have been the long standing editor in
chief of reviews in cardiovascular medicine,

242
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:14,585
which is now an international journal.

243
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:18,372
Our offices originally were in New
York and now they're in Hong Kong.

244
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,766
- And these are peer reviewed research journals.

245
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:24,056
- These are peer-reviewed journals,
widely cited. Journals that longstanding.

246
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:27,866
I became the editor in chief
of cardiorenal medicine.

247
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:32,306
That is published by Karger
and that's in Basel Switzerland.

248
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:35,451
And that brings together
cardiologists and nephrologists.

249
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:40,656
And I'm currently, and for several years now, been
the president of the Cardiorenal Society of America.

250
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:44,966
My major research focus is how the kidneys
and heart inner relate to one another

251
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:48,086
in terms of acute
and chronic disease so

252
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:52,466
over that period of time I've always had a blend
of clinical practice, teaching and research.

253
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:58,316
I've been productive, because I have really
enjoyed international collaborations.

254
00:13:59,036 --> 00:14:04,777
As we sit here today I have over 650
citations in the National Library of Medicine.

255
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:08,366
So if you were to search my name
in PubMed and put McCullough PA.

256
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:10,316
That's what what would come up.

257
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,806
- 650?
- 650.
- Wow.

258
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:18,026
- And, no, there's some ahead of me Dr
Robertson I mentioned I think he's well over a

259
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:20,025
thousand but there's not that many.
- Not many, no.

260
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,156
- Not many. And typical
number be twenty five would

261
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:26,912
be a number to become
a professor of medicine.

262
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:27,936
So...

263
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:34,063
I am also the the long standing
author of

264
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:38,186
a textbook on the interface between heart
and kidney disease in [Braunwald's?] textbook

265
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:41,546
of cardiology. That's considered the
Bible of cardiology that's published out of

266
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:44,696
Harvard Medical School and
Brigham and Women's Hospital.

267
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,502
And over the course of my career I've had
an absolutely wonderful career.

268
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:55,286
I've had a chance to present before the
committees at the National Institutes of Health,

269
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:59,276
the FDA, Congressional
oversight panels.

270
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:03,566
I've been in work groups
with Big Pharma and device.

271
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:05,876
I've chaired data safety
monitoring boards

272
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,816
for National Institutes of
Health programs as well as

273
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:10,616
Big Pharma programs and...

274
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:12,092
- That's relevant
for this conversation.

275
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:16,035
Very relevant and I've been involved in
some of these high stakes decisions.

276
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:20,336
One of the highest stakes decisions anyone can
make as a day safety monitoring board chair

277
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:22,976
because we're
entrusted with the safety

278
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:26,846
of participants in research as
well as the integrity of research

279
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,889
is to actually terminate a
program based on safety.

280
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:35,546
And I've been involved in those decisions.
In fact have led those decisions.

281
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:41,096
And I've had a lot of
intercommunication with the US FDA and

282
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:44,246
and have a good name
with them in terms of

283
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,936
a trusted name. There is a trust
relationship between academia

284
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,386
and our federal health
agencies and it's not just

285
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:54,296
the federal health agencies
are not just about funding.

286
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:57,986
They are about... we have an
inner reliance on one another.

287
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:03,626
In order to guide our country and the
world forward with respect to research.

288
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:08,426
- So being familiar with
this myself [...] this is as high

289
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:12,176
a level as you get in this
arena that [...] you've been in.

290
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:15,866
So you are definitely
an innovator, right?

291
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,036
But not a maverick where you're bucking the
system, it seems like, along the way, I mean.

292
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:24,846
Your 650 citations, you worked in
academia, you work in clinical practice.

293
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:30,576
You worked in executive, you know,
management positions, et cetera.

294
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:36,506
So how is it that now you find
yourself in this predicament where,

295
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,686
you know, what caused
you to speak up here?

296
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:48,516
You're about as traditional and high level in the medical
arena, the public health arena, as anybody can be.

297
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:53,347
Yet here you are now as a dissenting
voice to what's going on right now.

298
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:55,054
What caused you to step up and speak out?

299
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:58,885
- Thinking about it as you're
talking, maybe, I am a maverick.

300
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:06,236
You know, the original idea that kidney
disease could independently contribute to

301
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:10,616
manifestations of heart disease was
an innovative idea and I remember

302
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:13,946
some really long and lonely
nights at the heart meetings where,

303
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,506
you know, I was being drowned out by Big
Pharma and the cholesterol companies or

304
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:23,846
the blood pressure lowering agents and
others and I was making the case that the

305
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,266
in fact kidney disease could contribute
to heart disease and vice versa.

306
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:34,196
And that was a long long journey, like many
important observations that happened in history.

307
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:40,376
The first inkling of a new
idea many times is dismissed.

308
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:42,902
There's just been many
many examples of this

309
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:48,086
[...] the first time that an angioplasty
bloom was used to open up an artery or

310
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:51,711
to treat a heart attack
that was treated with great skepticism.

311
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:57,985
Skepticism is an important word,
because it is healthy in scientific debate.

312
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:03,086
Virtually every innovation that's come in
has been met with enormous skepticism

313
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:06,716
and then it goes through a vetting
process and the vetting process

314
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:11,916
takes dialogue, it takes
interpretation of data back and forth

315
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:17,782
getting viewpoints, identifying various stakeholders,
ultimately getting [...] consensus and moving forward.

316
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,306
It's very very
important. So skepticism

317
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,889
is an important part of the scientific process.
- Probably necessary, right?

318
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:27,386
I mean, without it then,
well, we end up where we are so.

319
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,016
We'll talk about that.

320
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:35,876
One of the things [...] that you're being accused
of, you and many others, is misinformation.

321
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,926
So how... and sometimes I
hear the word disinformation.

322
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:47,576
Maybe we could talk about how to... define or
categorize misinformation vs information and

323
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:51,656
[...] the debate that needs to
happen in order to get to the truth.

324
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:53,996
- Ok, maybe we just start with truth?
- Okay.

325
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,946
- So truth would be...

326
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:03,806
Let's say the correct description of the
state of affairs of something. That's truth.

327
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:10,776
And in medicine we use what's called
inference and that's different than deduction.

328
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:15,266
So inference means... we
can never really get to truth.

329
00:19:15,716 --> 00:19:20,186
What we do is we try to draw conclusions
from things around the truth and we keep

330
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:25,316
garnering information to know ultimately
what we think is the best course.

331
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:31,586
So, for example, can I really know
what's the best medicine for your body?

332
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,686
Can I really know that as truth?

333
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:34,806
I really can't.

334
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:35,886
But through inference,

335
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:39,356
by looking at clinical trials, research
studying you, studying your background

336
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,946
everything that I
can put together

337
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:43,136
I can conclude at
least one point in time

338
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,386
that yes this is the best
medical choice for you.

339
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:48,626
Now is that subject attain
change in the future? Absolutely.

340
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:52,907
But we always arrive at that
through a process of [...] inference.

341
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:54,706
So I want everyone
to understand that

342
00:19:55,016 --> 00:19:56,416
that this idea
that we're trying to

343
00:19:57,026 --> 00:20:02,156
get to... immutable...
unchangeable...

344
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:06,146
You know, brick of gold that
is just not going to change,

345
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:08,816
it doesn't happen in medicine,
everybody knows that.

346
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:13,016
So we try to get as close as we can
to truth through inference and we use

347
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:17,306
the scientific method, we use
every single tool we can have

348
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:21,266
epidemiology, I have a degree on this,
we've heard a lot [...] in the crisis about

349
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:22,736
the role of epidemiology.

350
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:29,096
Epidemiology is defined as the study of the
distribution and the determinants of disease.

351
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:34,226
Meaning, how is the disease distributed as
we see it in a population around the globe

352
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,339
and what are the determinants
[...] actually what's [...] causing it?

353
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:40,636
So if we can actually get to the
distributions and determinants

354
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,426
then we can actually do interventional
epidemiology which is actually true trying

355
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,236
something
to see if we can

356
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:50,276
modify the occurrence of disease or
severity of disease or influences' outcomes.

357
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:55,196
- So when we get to now
misinformation or information.

358
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:58,676
When does information
become misinformation?

359
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:00,506
- Well there's a
continuum, right?

360
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:08,946
If I said on one end the
continuum, you are perfectly bald.

361
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:14,546
And then on the other end of the continuum
I said you have a bushy head of hair, right?

362
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:17,966
And there are a lot of people look at
you and say, well, you know, I see a little

363
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:23,988
something there and [...] they'd
end up on a level of [...] continuum.

364
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:26,516
So, clearly a bushy
head of hair would be...

365
00:21:27,026 --> 00:21:28,683
No, that just can't be.
- That's misinformation.

366
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:30,026
- Yeah, that's misinformation.

367
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:35,066
"Perfectly bald" is people could still say, listen,
I see a little fuzz there. It's not perfectly bald.

368
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:37,916
I mean perfectly bald
obviously people could... define that.

369
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:44,156
So it's a continuum and is obviously in the eye
of the beholder, right? So someone must listen.

370
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:48,036
What we do in medicine is
we try to do some grounding.

371
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:54,516
And at least what we can do in grounding is we
can [...] grind to something that's published

372
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:59,306
or that's in was called preprints so it's at
least out there in some assembled fashion,

373
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:00,446
it's just not hearsay.

374
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:01,986
And the preprint...

375
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:06,626
has not yet gone through a peer review
process, but in the setting of emergency we're

376
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:10,196
very reliant on preprints because
that vetting process can be

377
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:13,256
two to four years before something
gets into print. It's not quick.

378
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:15,986
I'm the editor of two
major journals, I can tell you.

379
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:23,486
The papers that I've adjudicated and arbitrary decided
on many many months ago have not yet been published.

380
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:27,056
So we rely on preprints we
rely on published abstracts

381
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:32,216
we rely on a peer review published
manuscripts that are in PubMed

382
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:36,446
as much of the rapid information
that comes out and we do rely on

383
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:39,056
[...] the editors and
associate editors

384
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:42,026
and we rely on a corrective
process. Now listen.

385
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:45,956
If a paper comes out
and it turns out to be wrong

386
00:22:46,136 --> 00:22:48,956
and it's viewed by the
viewership and there's a lot of

387
00:22:49,256 --> 00:22:52,746
input that is wrong
it can be retracted,

388
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:55,766
there can be letters to the
editor to try to bring some,

389
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:59,786
you know, modulation
to it's interpretation.

390
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,427
All of that is fair game and
I have to tell the listeners

391
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:07,136
a redaction or a retraction
is extraordinarily rare.

392
00:23:07,646 --> 00:23:10,226
And I can tell you as
an editor for decades.

393
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:14,096
It would be a giant source
of embarrassment if

394
00:23:14,516 --> 00:23:17,876
a pub... a paper was
published under my watch.

395
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:21,896
Through two or more reviewers,
associate editors, myself,

396
00:23:22,256 --> 00:23:25,526
copyright people, other staff
and it turned out that it was

397
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:30,806
a fraudulent or fake paper that had to
be retracted and sadly we've seen that.

398
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:36,506
- I think we've seen a lot lately, when people are
writing things about a Covid or a Covid vaccine

399
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:40,016
and suddenly now...
publications are retracting.

400
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:43,496
So in your observation because
you would have a keen eye to kind of

401
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:45,536
spot what really
is going on here.

402
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:50,666
Do you think that... It's a... they're
yielding to political pressures or...

403
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:53,036
Why suddenly all
these retractions and

404
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:55,744
papers that passed peer
review and got published?

405
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,196
- What to my knowledge
there haven't been that many.

406
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:04,896
But we have seen something
happen in the medical literature [...],

407
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:08,306
you know, I'm in my fourth decade of
doing this, that I've never seen before.

408
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:16,376
And that is the introduction of
bias and bias in a selective way.

409
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:18,126
So...

410
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:22,796
What came out
early in 2020

411
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:29,306
I think was an honest representation
of what we thought was going on

412
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:33,972
it was a disease, it was a respiratory
disease, it appeared to have emanated out of China.

413
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:38,876
It looked like it was, you know,
had hit Milan, Italy next and then

414
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:43,976
different parts of the United States, New
York, West Coast, California, Seattle and

415
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:48,126
and there were just rapid communications.
What is this? What's happening?

416
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:52,016
Quickly reaching back in and a
lot of papers from the Chinese of

417
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:53,576
What is this virus?

418
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:54,756
What does it do?

419
00:24:54,986 --> 00:24:59,346
And we were enormously reliant
on the initial papers from China.

420
00:24:59,726 --> 00:25:01,736
And it [...] was
purely descriptive.

421
00:25:02,186 --> 00:25:04,416
And a lot of it was
observational and

422
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,646
there were sick patients in
the intensive care unit and

423
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:13,236
nephrologist and others said listen [...] the lines
that we're using to do dialysis were clotting.

424
00:25:13,316 --> 00:25:16,106
And there appears to be
blood clotting and then reports of

425
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:18,116
blood clots been
identified in patients we

426
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,276
you know within a few
months realize, wow,

427
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:23,966
at least in a very very sick patients
blood clotting was a disorder.

428
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:25,536
And then in terms of

429
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:28,976
what was going on, the radiographic
findings that look like the CT scan had a

430
00:25:28,976 --> 00:25:30,206
characteristic appearance, okay.

431
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:31,596
And then we...

432
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:34,616
The laboratory piece of this
moved pretty quickly and I

433
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,306
actually give America high marks
on this in terms of the big push on

434
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:41,046
how we got testing
and how quickly [...]

435
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:43,226
we had just realized
testing was important

436
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:44,936
During the HIV

437
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:49,646
outbreak and epidemic initially it was the same
thing is how important it was to get testing.

438
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:52,326
If this was something we
couldn't test for it you can imagine.

439
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:53,696
How difficult things would be.

440
00:25:54,146 --> 00:26:02,526
So as all this move forward in a confluence
through february, march, april, may

441
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:08,216
I started to become disturbed that we were
three months into it and we just did not

442
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:12,086
see these papers snapping into place
of what we should do about the virus.

443
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:13,526
What should we do?

444
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:16,376
It looked like a lot of
people are getting sick now.

445
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:18,536
Millions of them
are getting sick.

446
00:26:19,136 --> 00:26:24,516
It looked like there was a period
of time at home which was not short.

447
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:31,706
It could have been you know 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 10
days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks at home and then into the hospital.

448
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:35,366
So we had learned in this virus to
actually organize the illness by days

449
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,437
What was day zero? What
was your first day of symptoms?

450
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:42,823
And then, when did you get your test?
And then, when other things happened?

451
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:47,346
And initially what happened
is the tests were taking so long

452
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:51,146
that by the time we actually had a positive
test [we'd] be jeez we're five days into

453
00:26:51,146 --> 00:26:52,526
this, seven days into this, maybe

454
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:56,609
we got tested on day four
and we got the result back on day seven.

455
00:26:56,634 --> 00:27:00,261
So now we are eleven days into an illness
and now we're trying to jump into an action plan.

456
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:10,086
But... what I saw is I saw a lack of papers of
anybody describing any type of potential treatment.

457
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:13,136
And then there were
just some decisions made

458
00:27:13,436 --> 00:27:21,596
So, for instance, the Indian, medical council of India,
said for their healthcare workers and doctors

459
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:24,896
they were going to take once a week
hydroxychloroquine, they'd just put it out there

460
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:26,186
and communication in march.

461
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:29,827
And we were like, wow, that's pretty
impressive, maybe they know something about

462
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:35,126
this we don't. They would, you know, prior data
had supported hydroxychloroquine with SARS-CoV-1

463
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:39,596
and it was a lot of reliance on this
SARS-CoV-1 the first version of the SARS virus

464
00:27:39,596 --> 00:27:42,176
seventeen years ago
and SARS-CoV-2 have

465
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:46,776
a considerable overlap maybe 80 to 90
percent overlap that's my understanding.

466
00:27:47,246 --> 00:27:51,986
And... so that information was coming
out and nobody called it misinformation.

467
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:54,056
- It was just information.
- Right.
- Came out.

468
00:27:54,656 --> 00:28:00,446
But I can tell you, I think I got to an
alarm level in May - June timeframe.

469
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:02,256
I said listen,

470
00:28:02,456 --> 00:28:07,916
there are people dying now in significant
numbers and there is no roadmap on how to

471
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:11,816
treat this virus, to reduce
hospitalization and death.

472
00:28:12,146 --> 00:28:14,906
And as I saw my own
patients getting this illness

473
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:20,216
and looking at it I had come to a
fairly commonsensical conclusion.

474
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:26,886
That if this virus was like a flu or like a
cold and can be managed at home, fine.

475
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:29,666
As long as the person didn't
have to get hospitalized or die.

476
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:37,566
That would be a good outcome everyone agree [...] because the
hospitalization was unique, it was unique because it involved isolation.

477
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:40,076
It was unique because it
involved hazard to others

478
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:43,676
and there was great concern about
healthcare workers getting contaminated

479
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:47,316
or uber drivers, taxi
drivers, other relatives.

480
00:28:47,996 --> 00:28:51,596
The thought of somebody at
home steaming with this virus

481
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:54,656
getting to the point they
just couldn't manage anymore

482
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:56,186
and then calling for help

483
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:57,964
you've got to get to the
hospital somehow, right?

484
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:02,816
Family members, taxi drivers,
uber drivers or a paramedics

485
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,146
contamination big time, right?
'Cause someone is gasping for breath

486
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:08,047
and now they're
going to the hospital.

487
00:29:08,276 --> 00:29:10,016
Another wave of
contamination there

488
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:13,316
so the hospital [...]:
a) was a bad outcome

489
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:17,402
and it was a high risk for exposure of others
and clearly hospitalizations

490
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:22,463
in my view as an epidemiologist must
have fueled the spread of the illness.

491
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:26,516
Because what we saw was an amplification
of wherever the outbreaks were.

492
00:29:26,858 --> 00:29:29,876
So if it started to get bad in New
York it got worse in New York.

493
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:32,186
It's not like it
just spread as a

494
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:36,206
as an ebbing wave across
the United States and so...

495
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:39,836
As a leader in medicine
I started to get alarmed

496
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:43,826
and I quickly got out
the first publication

497
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,886
and I took the liberty of
publishing in my own journal

498
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:50,606
separate editor decided on
it, separate set of reviewers

499
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:54,926
and the title of the paper dealt with
the fact that this outbreak is occurring in

500
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:57,326
clusters and we
need information.

501
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,786
We were getting deaths reported

502
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,476
but there wasn't any uniform report in
hospitalizations I said listen though those

503
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:04,476
two things count.

504
00:30:04,856 --> 00:30:07,526
These people being test
positive in their community.

505
00:30:07,886 --> 00:30:11,426
You know, it can be everything from
somebody who has no symptoms whatsoever

506
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,926
to somebody who's going to die

507
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:16,646
but that testing in the communities were missing
the hospitalizations and it was a giant call

508
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,718
hospitalizations hospitalizations we need
them we need them we need them.

509
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:21,644
We needed a national
hospital census.

510
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:25,727
5600 hospitals, 2200 acute
care hospitals. We needed.

511
00:30:25,976 --> 00:30:26,976
We never got it.

512
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:32,726
We got an executive order from our
president to say, listen, all positive test

513
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:35,696
results get reported to a
[db?], the lab just reports them.

514
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,726
Not much other information
outside of "test goes..."

515
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:43,626
and then the CDC has had a... loose
voluntary collection of hospital reporting

516
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:48,566
But things got so tight
in terms of tension.

517
00:30:48,956 --> 00:30:52,326
I'll never forget former
governor Cuomo

518
00:30:52,706 --> 00:30:54,746
saying, listen, we're going
to run out of ventilators

519
00:30:55,016 --> 00:30:59,066
General Motors, we're going to ask General
Motors [...] to make ventilators and

520
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:02,036
former President Trump [would
say] General Motors, I said my gosh

521
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:03,765
You know I used
to live in Detroit.

522
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:07,976
These types of plants, you
know, are not... can't make precise

523
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:12,236
medical equipment in an automobile
plant, but [...] that just exemplified the

524
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:16,026
desperation that we had in
not knowing what was going on.

525
00:31:16,226 --> 00:31:17,276
Another example was

526
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:21,116
this giant medical relief boat that went
up into New York and into the harbor

527
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:24,806
is because we didn't know
what hospitals were over flowing

528
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:27,806
which ones weren't
there was [...] this panic.

529
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,616
But we just needed data because we
actually have a robust hospital system

530
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:34,418
and if this was just a
matter of distributing patients

531
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:36,832
to the hospitals with capacity,
we could have done it.

532
00:31:37,226 --> 00:31:48,846
In fact the CEO of my former hospital, William
Beaumont hospital in Royal at Michigan, published a

533
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:53,246
[abettor?], a news piece where he just
flabbergasted and say listen we have to report

534
00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:57,506
where the patients are because the
paramedics don't know where to go.

535
00:31:57,686 --> 00:32:00,416
They can't be taking patients
to hospitals that are overflowing.

536
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:02,756
So it was that panic going on.

537
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:07,926
That also solidified in my mind that
the hospitalizations were a key outcome.

538
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:16,136
And no matter what, we needed leadership to say that we
are going to reduce these hospitalizations and deaths

539
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:19,586
and the only opportunity to do
that is in the prehospital period.

540
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:25,566
- Well, and this is [...] about mid 2020 or so when this [all was going on]?
- This is about 2020.

541
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,906
- You know, one of
the things [...] that [...]

542
00:32:28,376 --> 00:32:31,796
a point of controversy right now as we
talk about testing is the PCR test and it's

543
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:32,796
validity for

544
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:37,436
what we're doing. So what are your thoughts
around PCR as being the the determinant as

545
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:39,626
to whether somebody is
infected or not?

546
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:47,996
- Because SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus
and it's possible to detect strands of RNA

547
00:32:48,296 --> 00:32:53,466
in secretions, it was amenable to
the polymerase chain reaction test.

548
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:59,276
And originally our center for disease control
since they had dealt with other outbreaks

549
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:05,036
had methodology for a polymerase
chain reaction that could be applied

550
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:08,336
to SARS-CoV-2 and it
was based on certain targets.

551
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:12,846
The one I'm aware of is what's called the
polymerase one of the enzymes in SARS-CoV-2.

552
00:33:13,406 --> 00:33:17,556
But it's a pretty
short strand of RNA.

553
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:25,736
And when there was this initial desperate
call for some way to test for the virus

554
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:28,406
the CDC step forward
and said listen we've got

555
00:33:29,636 --> 00:33:31,886
a method we've got a methodology

556
00:33:32,186 --> 00:33:35,726
so all the hospitals
that I'm aware of initially

557
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:39,146
were very likely to
work with the CDC

558
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:44,066
to use their [...] methodology to develop a
test what's called a laboratory derived essay

559
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:47,066
of which they could get
a fairly rapid approval

560
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:51,296
from the regulatory authorities
for hospital use.

561
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:53,576
And so that's what
hospitals did originally.

562
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:56,096
Because the manufacturers
needed time, right?

563
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,736
So you look at the big
ones Abbott, Quest and

564
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:03,926
Labcorp and Roche clinical diagnostics,
Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, they needed time

565
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:06,626
to come up with their
proprietary methods

566
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:14,546
in order to get them onto [...] a big multi-stage
platform that they would use in a big hospital labs [...]

567
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:17,456
So the initial CDC
methodology was critical.

568
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:24,266
What [had] happened, is there was a discovery
much later and disclosure by the CDC

569
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:32,516
that those methods could not distinguish between
influenza and strains of influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

570
00:34:33,836 --> 00:34:40,496
So during the spring and summer of
2020 it may not have mattered because

571
00:34:40,826 --> 00:34:43,556
Influenza has a
seasonality to it so

572
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:45,926
you know the flu season
was winding down we had

573
00:34:46,076 --> 00:34:49,536
started this SARS-CoV-2 season
which was spring and summer.

574
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:56,216
But it probably did matter in the fall and
winter of [...] the 2020 into 21.

575
00:34:56,936 --> 00:35:08,796
Because the degree to which the CDC methodology were still relied
upon, it could have diagnosed somebody who had influenza with Covid.

576
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:11,936
If separate influenza and
Covid tests weren't done.

577
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:16,346
And you can imagine this is
[...] could easily be done where

578
00:35:16,556 --> 00:35:22,746
let's say a senior citizen develops a
fever chills, nasal congestion, body aches.

579
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:25,976
Presents to an ER [emergency room]
we're in the middle of a Covid pandemic.

580
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:31,376
Why wouldn't they get a Covid test
and establish Covid it was positive

581
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:35,636
and then they would be treated as if they
have Covid so a high risk patient would

582
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:36,636
have been admitted,

583
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,676
would have been put in isolation, so he can't
see the family members for a period of time,

584
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:44,996
would have started courses of therapy, particularly
if the oxygen saturation was lower they

585
00:35:44,996 --> 00:35:46,986
would have followed what we had

586
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:50,696
in October of 2020 we had at National
Institutes of Health guidelines that

587
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:54,596
suggested the use of remdesivir,
use of dexamethason

588
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:56,936
and then on the line
for other treatments but

589
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,172
most of those would have been

590
00:35:58,196 --> 00:36:02,704
inappropriate for influenza and [...]
[what's normally?] the misdiagnosis of it.

591
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:09,746
So there never was an attempt to go back in and
reclassify. I haven't seen any investigations to figure out

592
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:15,006
to what degree do the
commercial laboratories rely upon

593
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:20,096
principles of the CDC methodology. So how
much of this misdiagnosis was done through the

594
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,096
commercial labs.

595
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:25,676
Is not it... It may be known it's just
that it's not in my domain of knowledge.

596
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:29,005
-  It's interesting cause I know a lot of
the controversy was the way the tests were

597
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:32,606
being conducted, how many amplification
cycles are going through, you know, and

598
00:36:32,906 --> 00:36:34,136
how they're getting positives

599
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:38,426
and that it wasn't uniform as far as from lab
the lab, you know, how they were doing it.

600
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:42,541
Yet, you know, they're getting all this
data and they're making decisions, you know,

601
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:46,556
based on this data and [...] as you
said [...] maybe that somebody with flu.

602
00:36:47,096 --> 00:36:51,296
The other thing I found a little puzzling
so from an epidemiological standpoint when

603
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:53,126
you looked at... you
know, cause there

604
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:57,546
were, there's a lot of fear. I mean, hey,
[...] and as you said it was very disorienting

605
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,686
at that time early in 2020 etc

606
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:03,806
You know, people are getting sick, there seem
to be concentrations, our hospitals getting

607
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:07,046
overrun, we don't really understand the
disease at all, nobody really knows anything

608
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:13,086
and, you know, people are running
scared and [...] those flames were fanned.

609
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:18,926
But when you start to look now at the
all-cause mortality year over year

610
00:37:19,316 --> 00:37:22,536
the death rates don't really
seem to vary very much.

611
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:24,326
You know, pre Covid into the Covid.

612
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:25,796
So is there...

613
00:37:26,636 --> 00:37:30,866
I guess could you really characterize as a
deadly pandemic, when you don't see a spike

614
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:36,026
in death rates during the
epidemic itself or the pandemic itself?

615
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:41,936
- Mortality has been the most difficult
part of Covid epidemiology, I think.

616
00:37:43,016 --> 00:37:52,586
Because [...] we learned that the viral infection was
subject to risk stratification for the outcomes of mortality.

617
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:59,306
Meaning, that a young person, let's say
somebody under age fifty no medical problems,

618
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:04,226
would be at a very very low chance of
death, you're far less than one percent.

619
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:06,836
Whereas someone
in their 80s or 90s

620
00:38:07,196 --> 00:38:13,016
that could be considerably higher and that could
be tenfold, twenty fold, forty fold higher.

621
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:18,776
So as subject to risk stratification by age,
by comorbidities, obesity, diabetes, heart

622
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:20,936
and lung disease,
kidney disease, cancer.

623
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:29,486
So because of this risk stratification the idea if you take
a really large [...] denominator including people who are

624
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:34,286
who are getting tests for, you know, asymptomatically,
what have you, one could make the claim

625
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:36,836
that the mortality rate
is astonishingly low.

626
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:44,066
Because co-morbidities are [...]
determinants of mortality. One could say that

627
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:47,426
listen, it wasn't all Covid,
they had other problems

628
00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:52,526
and so we heard all kinds of misinformation
and information on this continuum, right?

629
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:56,696
So, this is what I would
say is misinformation:

630
00:38:57,446 --> 00:39:00,146
There are people who claimed
"Covid doesn't exist".

631
00:39:00,776 --> 00:39:06,956
It doesn't exist, it's really just a version
of the flu, the virus has never been isolated.

632
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:10,046
These people are dying of
conditions they would die of anyway

633
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:11,846
the whole thing is a hoax.

634
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:16,406
I can tell you from my vantage
point, I don't think it's a hoax

635
00:39:16,526 --> 00:39:19,616
I mean, I think it's a real
virus, I think it's a real disease

636
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:28,166
I've seen the studies where the [...] viruses
is, you know, handled in a [...] test tube

637
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:34,016
and it's infected cells and the infectivity
of [...] cell cultures is studied.

638
00:39:34,766 --> 00:39:40,404
That the virus has been sequenced and we have, you
know, sequencing studies to tell us what variants.

639
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:48,356
There are methods by which really good labs, our
CDC and department Cuban health labs, the UK labs

640
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:51,206
where they actually figure out
the variants, actually figure out the

641
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:56,336
genetic code for the spike protein
the nuclear capsid envelope and others

642
00:39:56,463 --> 00:39:58,366
and they can actually figure out mutations.

643
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:05,516
To me it would be misinformation to say it doesn't exist.
It'd be misinformation to say it's not a fatal disease.

644
00:40:06,026 --> 00:40:08,148
But getting under
the sight of information

645
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:10,956
the real question is, well,
how much did it contribute.

646
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:20,352
Now our CDC says fairly that there is somewhat less
than 10% where COVID-19 is the sole cause of death.

647
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:25,676
Sole cause of death. Meaning somebody ostensibly
healthy with no medical problems, [oh] boy,

648
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,717
there are almost always
going to pull through.

649
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:33,356
But conversely, someone my age, yo, I've
already picked up some medical problems

650
00:40:34,526 --> 00:40:35,876
you know, I would
have been categorized

651
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:40,736
if I would've passed away of Covid of
being in that 90% who had co-morbidities.

652
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,876
So I think it is deterministic for death, I
mean, by and large people get sick with a

653
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,946
respiratory illness
it's the primary thing.

654
00:40:47,726 --> 00:40:49,006
They get admitted
to the hospital

655
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,477
all the other medical problems
make it difficult to treat.

656
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:54,596
- Yeah, and I guess if you'd started
to say, you know, by age group

657
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:57,838
'cause I think it's important
like saying what is the risk?

658
00:40:58,198 --> 00:41:01,318
'cause part of the conversation should we be
vaccinating kids? Should we be you know...

659
00:41:01,517 --> 00:41:06,298
[...] Should people who are in their thirties
and healthy be forced to be vaccinated many of

660
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:09,098
these real conversations,
I think we'll get into.

661
00:41:09,448 --> 00:41:16,468
[...] but now [...] I think where you left off your mid last year [2020]
at what point did you feel like you just started speaking publicly

662
00:41:16,948 --> 00:41:22,948
[...] and being critical of some of the [...]
healthcare policy that's being made right now.

663
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:28,138
You know, because [...] you've now attracted
a lot of properly unwanted attention.

664
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:31,481
- I remember some of
these calls, I mean, all the

665
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:35,239
health systems had
open calls, we had open

666
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:37,828
forums where there
was information and

667
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:41,848
everyone was getting alarmed,
we had some terrific people at

668
00:41:42,178 --> 00:41:47,788
[...] Baylor University Medical Center where they had decided
who's going to take care of the sicking patients, really dedicated

669
00:41:47,968 --> 00:41:51,178
critical care internal medicine
doctors, people I respect greatly.

670
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:55,678
They it became clear that they were going
to take enormous risks there we're going to

671
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,298
take care of the
sick patients and

672
00:41:57,658 --> 00:41:59,656
how to organize all
the protective equipment

673
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:02,458
[...] some real
thought put into it and

674
00:42:02,818 --> 00:42:04,847
I give Baylor Scott &
White Health system

675
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:07,678
a lot of credit, they never
overflowed they [...] knew where the

676
00:42:07,678 --> 00:42:10,768
ventilators were, it was well managed,
well managed, very proud of that.

677
00:42:11,098 --> 00:42:12,458
But I remember
some of these calls

678
00:42:12,868 --> 00:42:14,218
as a few months went on.

679
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:15,908
Some discussions of

680
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:19,918
gosh are we gonna start treating this in the
community? Otherwise how are we going to stop a

681
00:42:19,918 --> 00:42:24,418
hospitalization unless we are not going to treat
it and [...] people just didn't have answers

682
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:29,068
and so I started reaching out to Italian
colleagues, I had just been to Italy a few

683
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:31,258
years earlier [and got]
colleagues in Siena.

684
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:35,308
Via them colleagues in Milan
we started communities at coracle,

685
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:37,348
research network
that [had] a lot of data.

686
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:43,088
They had in certain centers run out of personal
protective equipment, they had some exposures.

687
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,127
Wide open, they were
actually even publishing

688
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:47,068
some list of doctors
who passed away and

689
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:50,878
that scared us like
you cannot believe as

690
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,948
Milan was getting walloped with

691
00:42:53,368 --> 00:42:55,318
COVID-19 and it was
spreading to New York.

692
00:42:55,768 --> 00:43:04,708
So I felt very very strongly that we
had to develop approach to treat patients

693
00:43:05,128 --> 00:43:08,308
before they came to the hospital.

694
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:12,338
I felt incredibly stronger [...] I reached
out to the Italians I said what do you think?

695
00:43:12,658 --> 00:43:14,878
Reached out to other key
leaders, I had leaders from

696
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:19,858
very very well known institutions across
the United States and everyone agreed.

697
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,058
And I said listen
this looks like

698
00:43:22,288 --> 00:43:23,968
one of the only
things we may have

699
00:43:24,298 --> 00:43:26,158
prehospital is
hydroxychloroquine

700
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:33,451
and but [...] we had used it for rheumatoid
arthritis, systemic lupus, malaria prevention.

701
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:38,218
It had some known toxicities, the
cardiac toxicities, that we knew about.

702
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,528
We actually had an electrophysiologist as an
author, because we [...] wanted to be able

703
00:43:43,528 --> 00:43:46,414
to backstop that and say, listen, we had
somebody who really knows about cardiac

704
00:43:46,438 --> 00:43:48,308
arrhythmias in the author block.

705
00:43:48,388 --> 00:43:54,958
We also had an ophthalmologist, because we really wanted someone who
knew about the toxicity to say, listen, this is reasonable to do this.

706
00:43:55,498 --> 00:43:58,648
The toxicities both acute and
chronic we understood well.

707
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:00,418
The data were emerging.

708
00:44:00,988 --> 00:44:02,338
And I was a driver

709
00:44:02,728 --> 00:44:08,938
and I said, listen, we are going to look
for signals of benefit, acceptable safety

710
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:13,598
with the fundamental understanding
that we think we have at the time.

711
00:44:13,648 --> 00:44:17,968
That there's a phase of viral replication,
there's a phase of inflammation or cytokine storm

712
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:22,888
and then there is this overlap or
shading in of what we think is lethal,

713
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:26,258
witch is thrombosis,
blood clotting,

714
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:30,628
either macro thrombosis, big strokes, big
heart attacks, big blood clots in the legs and

715
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:35,858
lungs or micro thrombosis, just the the lungs
literally filling up with, with thrombi.

716
00:44:36,418 --> 00:44:39,548
So that paper was put together.

717
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:45,808
And it had a key flow diagram
that said step one - risk stratification

718
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:48,118
you know, it was a very
very important tenant

719
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:53,518
and it was risk stratification based on
the demographics, age and medically

720
00:44:53,698 --> 00:44:57,028
not risk stratification based on severity
of disease and this was different.

721
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:00,838
The Indians had come already come out
with a with [afformative] approach there

722
00:45:01,227 --> 00:45:04,321
and in India they said based on
severity disease risk stratification.

723
00:45:04,346 --> 00:45:05,918
I always thought that was risky.

724
00:45:06,028 --> 00:45:12,275
Because the name of the illness is SARS -
sudden acute respiratory distress syndrome

725
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,188
meaning somebody can really
go down quickly and this idea of

726
00:45:17,368 --> 00:45:21,958
waiting, based on severity of symptoms
to start something, never made sense.

727
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:25,168
- Incidentally cause that
[...] was the predicament.

728
00:45:25,528 --> 00:45:27,298
Today almost same
thing, right? It's just

729
00:45:27,688 --> 00:45:28,688
You [know] - stay home,

730
00:45:29,158 --> 00:45:32,278
try to ride it out and if it gets so
bad that you have to go to hospital

731
00:45:32,548 --> 00:45:34,738
you go to hospital and
there's just nothing in between.

732
00:45:35,308 --> 00:45:41,419
So you started investigating early intervention
with [...] known medicines, like hydroxychloroquine

733
00:45:41,728 --> 00:45:46,918
and then ivermectin, did you explore that?
and [...] is this would start bring it like

734
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:48,508
you start speaking
publicly about this?

735
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:51,448
- Right, well, what would happen, I
mean, there was a lot of groundwork so

736
00:45:51,718 --> 00:45:54,868
back in march I worked
with colleagues at Baylor

737
00:45:55,288 --> 00:45:59,038
and we applied for investigational new
drug application for hydroxychloroquine

738
00:45:59,518 --> 00:46:04,258
and our first approach was to
use it weekly to try to prevent

739
00:46:05,158 --> 00:46:09,328
COVID-19 in our healthcare workers, our frontline
workers, our ER [emergency room] workers and

740
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:13,104
our critical care doctors and
there was great subscription to this

741
00:46:13,129 --> 00:46:16,318
it would [be] hundreds of people that signed
up for this it was organized protocols.

742
00:46:17,158 --> 00:46:18,778
We worked over a
weekend with the

743
00:46:18,928 --> 00:46:22,348
FDA to get the investigation drug
application that was held at my name.

744
00:46:23,038 --> 00:46:24,038
And

745
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:27,808
We got the hydroxychloroquine acquire, we got
Grant funding, I mean, things were really

746
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:28,978
humming and I was busy.

747
00:46:29,398 --> 00:46:38,648
So I was paying attention to Covid in march heavily
in that [...] program brought me into it heavily.

748
00:46:38,788 --> 00:46:42,838
And it was around
Easter time of 2020

749
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:47,082
my dad got Covid and he
was at a rehabilitation center.

750
00:46:47,106 --> 00:46:48,778
He had a pelvic fracture, dementia.

751
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:54,328
And so I had this really proximal
family member encounter where he had

752
00:46:54,628 --> 00:46:58,838
been moved to a brand new Covid unit, he was
the only patient there and he's confused.

753
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:00,248
The nurses,

754
00:47:00,538 --> 00:47:04,048
heroic nurses put on Hazmat [hazardous materials]
suits and they didn't know how to deal with my dad.

755
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:07,708
And fortunately there was a
physician assistant and doctor.

756
00:47:08,098 --> 00:47:13,738
When we start talking, what can we possibly do? I mean,
this is pretty early, [...] his respiratory mechanics are

757
00:47:13,738 --> 00:47:15,958
going to be impaired, he
can't sit up well, he can't

758
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:20,548
navigate, how can he possibly take
care of himself and so we agreed on a plan.

759
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:25,288
It was an empiric plan, but it relied
upon hydroxychloroquine, [azithromycin],

760
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:30,022
nutrients and supplements, including
zinc and vitamin D and vitamin C.

761
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:34,498
We knew about blood clotting, so it
involved the use of lovenox or enoxaparin.

762
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:38,968
Opening the windows which is never done
in a nursing home or rehab center, getting

763
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:41,758
fresh air, sterilizing all
the surfaces in the room

764
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:46,288
and just honestly hoping for the best
because his wishes were to never be

765
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:49,228
hospitalized or going to
ventilator, so that was out.

766
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:53,278
So it's going to be treat there and that
was it and everybody knew the parameters.

767
00:47:53,758 --> 00:47:55,378
While it was a long illness

768
00:47:56,638 --> 00:48:05,848
but fortunately because we started early, he didn't develop this
ravaging pulmonary involvement, it was nasal congestion, fever,

769
00:48:06,388 --> 00:48:13,358
loss of taste and smell, dehydration, severe dehydration
to a point where he needed some IV-fluids [intravenous].

770
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:14,938
And all done there

771
00:48:15,628 --> 00:48:20,068
And just a long illness, I would say
probably about sixty days, his course of

772
00:48:20,068 --> 00:48:21,568
treatment was thirty days.

773
00:48:22,078 --> 00:48:26,788
And he intermittently tested positive for
ever and so the idea of what we learned

774
00:48:26,788 --> 00:48:29,428
over time is, wow,
once this PCR is positive

775
00:48:29,788 --> 00:48:33,448
it's going to stay positive for a long time
so watch out, it just doesn't turn on and

776
00:48:33,448 --> 00:48:38,278
turn off and probably lots of [...]
dead virus or even other organisms, so

777
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,808
I had a personal experience.

778
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:43,648
We had our investigational
drug application.

779
00:48:44,038 --> 00:48:46,258
Then patients in my
practice started getting sick.

780
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:50,968
And just like they got sick with
pneumonia or asthma or heart attack

781
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:56,038
I took care of them, using the best
judgment I could, using this approach,

782
00:48:56,368 --> 00:49:00,988
hydroxychloroquine and other drugs and then we
learned about the importance of steroids so use of

783
00:49:01,258 --> 00:49:04,120
dexamethasone or prednisone
and then inhaled budesonide.

784
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:08,978
So as we learned by [...] the
summer the Greeks had published

785
00:49:09,388 --> 00:49:13,948
a randomized trial of Colchicine,
actually, anti inflammatory gout drug.

786
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,368
That looked pretty good.

787
00:49:15,418 --> 00:49:19,849
I personally used and I suggested that we
use what's called the precautionary principle

788
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:22,438
that we take the precaution

789
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:30,058
of treating ahead of having large
scale clinical trials and having

790
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:35,308
various organizations
endorse treatment guidelines.

791
00:49:35,698 --> 00:49:40,078
Because the large randomized trials typically
take many years and that is many years

792
00:49:40,078 --> 00:49:41,398
after that for guidelines.

793
00:49:41,848 --> 00:49:45,008
It just doesn't go any other way than
that it always starts out with innovation,

794
00:49:45,328 --> 00:49:49,028
precautionary principle, learning
from others, communicating

795
00:49:49,588 --> 00:49:53,248
as best as we possibly can and that's
what I got thrown into so the first paper

796
00:49:53,608 --> 00:49:57,478
multi-author US, Italy,
academic, community practice,

797
00:49:57,868 --> 00:50:02,618
submitted to the American Journal of
Medicine and accepted there... quickly.

798
00:50:02,687 --> 00:50:05,728
And it had this key [froward funding?]
I mean the title of paper was

799
00:50:06,118 --> 00:50:10,499
"The pathophysiologic rationale for
the early [ambulatory?] treatment of Covid".

800
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:13,804
I didn't say I had proof, I
just said it was a rationale

801
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:16,738
this is the rationale for
why we should do this

802
00:50:16,978 --> 00:50:18,478
why we should do it now.

803
00:50:18,928 --> 00:50:19,928
As opposed to wait.

804
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:23,470
No, I mean, I respectfully
acknowledge others' views.

805
00:50:23,495 --> 00:50:25,858
I [...] was on many a call
where people said, you know,

806
00:50:26,278 --> 00:50:28,888
we need to wait for
large randomized trials.

807
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:31,468
We need to wait, no, people said that.
- But why?

808
00:50:31,648 --> 00:50:34,618
- Because... you need to be certain.
- People are dying in the meantime.

809
00:50:35,188 --> 00:50:37,978
- Of what we do. The
counter argument was

810
00:50:38,188 --> 00:50:42,120
we don't want to put false hopes up
for people, we don't want to treat people

811
00:50:42,145 --> 00:50:44,158
and give them false
hope. I heard that.

812
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,550
I heard the other thing is:

813
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:49,738
there could be new toxicities with these drugs.
I mean, the drugs are very old but what if

814
00:50:49,738 --> 00:50:52,858
we start using [them] on a broad scale
there could be new toxicity so.

815
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,678
We respectively have
fielded these arguments

816
00:50:56,158 --> 00:51:00,238
and when [it] was published in American Journal
of Medicine it really went on big to this day

817
00:51:00,478 --> 00:51:05,458
my understanding is this most frequently
downloaded [and utilized] paper from that journal.

818
00:51:05,483 --> 00:51:06,599
- Wow.
- With respect to COVID-19

819
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:09,904
The letters of the editors
came in. Which was

820
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:18,244
interesting to see and they came in from Duke
University, Monash, I believe from, McGill, from Brazil.

821
00:51:18,354 --> 00:51:19,704
I think there were six in total.

822
00:51:20,304 --> 00:51:25,724
And the letters the editor largely said, you
know, you don't have enough evidence to do this.

823
00:51:26,154 --> 00:51:33,616
Or, you know, you can't do this. Or if you do
this, it's going to cause harm to populations.

824
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:36,204
And, you know, the letters
to the editors, they were really

825
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:38,934
detracting not a single
one said, wow, attaboy.

826
00:51:39,774 --> 00:51:41,459
Not a single one.
- Were you shocked by that?

827
00:51:41,484 --> 00:51:43,554
- No, no, I mean,
this is skepticism.

828
00:51:44,364 --> 00:51:45,444
This is skepticism.

829
00:51:45,744 --> 00:51:49,134
Now if I had come out of the box
with my first paper on a vaccine,

830
00:51:49,884 --> 00:51:52,524
I should have gotten
skeptical letters to the editor.

831
00:51:52,854 --> 00:51:55,125
Right? But I came out
with a therapeutic protocol,

832
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,774
this [...] is the dialogue in
medicine that we have

833
00:51:58,064 --> 00:51:59,891
And my response [to the] letter
to the editor was

834
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,444
You know, we can do this.

835
00:52:01,554 --> 00:52:03,240
And we should do this
and here's the reason why.

836
00:52:03,264 --> 00:52:06,354
And as time went on we just had more
supportive data, oh, here's some more supportive

837
00:52:06,379 --> 00:52:08,119
[station?] hydroxychloroquine,
here's some more [size?].

838
00:52:08,634 --> 00:52:10,410
And so it just kept
coming. At one point in time

839
00:52:10,434 --> 00:52:12,204
we even had an
updated protocol so...

840
00:52:13,044 --> 00:52:18,174
As things started to move along, I had communications
[...] with Peter Navarro in the White House

841
00:52:18,474 --> 00:52:22,524
about trying to do something worth our
emergency use authorization hydroxychloroquine

842
00:52:22,524 --> 00:52:24,580
Because we had...
- Would you like to talk about that a little bit?

843
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:28,904
- I can, I mean Peter called me.
- So talking about his position at the White House.

844
00:52:28,974 --> 00:52:32,814
- Yeah, I don't understand all of it but
I understand that he played a role

845
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:37,944
with Steven Hatfill at the time to try to
get a stockpile of hydroxychloroquine.

846
00:52:39,054 --> 00:52:42,954
[And] the US recognition that, wow,
it looks like, this looks pretty good

847
00:52:43,224 --> 00:52:46,674
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">[An in vitro study occurs in a controlled
environment, such as a test tube or petri dish.]</font>

848
00:52:43,224 --> 00:52:46,674
to reduce viral replication in vitro studies.

849
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:52,054
And the initial studies that we saw, looked
like it could have a clinical benefit.

850
00:52:52,433 --> 00:52:59,034
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00"> [de Pádua Covas Lage LA?]</font>

851
00:52:52,433 --> 00:52:59,034
Doctor Didier Raoult in France and Matthew Milan
and doctor [Lage?] and others were working with it.

852
00:52:59,814 --> 00:53:04,704
And so there was a stockpile and which
would have been wonderful for clinical use.

853
00:53:05,454 --> 00:53:08,754
But the emergency use authorization, a
lot of us didn't even know what that was.

854
00:53:09,114 --> 00:53:13,074
At first it sounded good, like, wow,
we're kind of authorized to use this.

855
00:53:13,914 --> 00:53:17,094
But it was actually for the
hospital, so the thought was

856
00:53:17,544 --> 00:53:21,234
well, maybe we're going to run out and we
should use it in sick hospitalized people...

857
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:23,916
- That's defeats the whole purpose
of what you were developing it for.

858
00:53:23,941 --> 00:53:27,594
- I know, but [...] it didn't sink
in at first, I have to tell you.

859
00:53:28,224 --> 00:53:32,904
What we effectively realized is that, wait
a minute, this is [...] a restriction.

860
00:53:33,504 --> 00:53:39,384
This is [...] not broadening use. It in a sense
meant we were emergency authorized to use it

861
00:53:39,624 --> 00:53:42,564
in the hospital which [...] we
use it in the hospital anyway for

862
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:46,724
Lupus, sick Lupus patients,
Rheumatoid arthritis patients...

863
00:53:46,816 --> 00:53:48,144
- But [...] if I could
ask a question there...

864
00:53:48,444 --> 00:53:54,894
And, you know, obviously the success rate if you're
waiting 'till somebody's "hospital sick", if you will,

865
00:53:55,464 --> 00:53:58,584
is going to go way way down and it's
going to make it look like it doesn't work

866
00:53:58,674 --> 00:54:02,334
as compared to the whole idea, it was the early treatments, right?
- It's where we had mixed data...

867
00:54:02,634 --> 00:54:04,164
So Henry Ford,

868
00:54:04,554 --> 00:54:09,174
came in with a study, where they started
hydroxychloroquine on day one in the hospital

869
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:10,852
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">[Treatment with Hydroxychloroquine Cut Death Rate Significantly
in COVID-19 Patients, Henry Ford Health System Study Shows]</font>

870
00:54:09,174 --> 00:54:12,504
they consented patients, made really
good study, it wasn't a randomized trial

871
00:54:12,774 --> 00:54:16,374
but they had a thousands of patients
here Henry Ford hospital in Detroit

872
00:54:16,614 --> 00:54:19,824
place I knew really well, the
quality was impeccable in the data

873
00:54:20,214 --> 00:54:22,434
and it was associated
with a mortality reduction.

874
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:25,644
But then other papers came
in that said wait a minute

875
00:54:26,094 --> 00:54:29,124
those who received
hydroxychloroquine had higher mortality.

876
00:54:29,694 --> 00:54:30,774
Well you can imagine

877
00:54:31,164 --> 00:54:36,444
this idea of at least Henry Ford
they started it broadly in patients

878
00:54:36,744 --> 00:54:39,664
early on and patients signed consent
so they knew what they're up against.

879
00:54:40,254 --> 00:54:45,114
If patients were started on
hydroxychloroquine late as a last ditch effort

880
00:54:45,444 --> 00:54:47,544
that's called
confounding by indication,

881
00:54:47,904 --> 00:54:50,664
meaning that doctors could
have actually selected people,

882
00:54:51,114 --> 00:54:55,014
who they were most worried about, to use
hydroxychloroquine and in fact it could look

883
00:54:55,014 --> 00:54:57,974
like it's associated with mortality but
it was just [that] sicker people got it.

884
00:54:58,434 --> 00:55:05,214
And so those other papers came in and so we
ended up with this mixed in hospital data piece.

885
00:55:05,724 --> 00:55:12,924
And then the shoe really dropped, when the paper
was published in Lancet using Surgisphere data.

886
00:55:13,464 --> 00:55:17,004
And Surgisphere is a company, none of us
really knew about, but they claim to have

887
00:55:17,004 --> 00:55:19,734
data on hospitalized
patients with COVID-19.

888
00:55:20,604 --> 00:55:28,234
And it also, like some of these other papers, demonstrated
an increased hazard for mortality with hydroxychloroquine.

889
00:55:28,734 --> 00:55:32,604
And [it] was a very large dataset though,
I mean, tens of thousands of patients

890
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:34,614
but the mean age
was in their forties

891
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:37,564
and, you know, we didn't
hospitalize people in their forties and

892
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:41,154
there was a lot of questions of could this
be legitimate, so people started actually

893
00:55:41,154 --> 00:55:43,494
writing the editors listen
[buddy], what is this?

894
00:55:43,734 --> 00:55:45,174
One of the authors
was at Harvard.

895
00:55:45,774 --> 00:55:51,684
And then about two weeks later without
any explanation it was just... retracted.

896
00:55:52,164 --> 00:55:53,634
Lancet said, retracted.

897
00:55:54,114 --> 00:55:57,954
And I have to tell you that Lancet is a high bar
is like [The New England Journal of Medicine]

898
00:55:58,067 --> 00:56:03,114
for the world. They have really
deep associate editors, reviewers.

899
00:56:04,052 --> 00:56:07,284
I've been a reviewer for Lancet.
I've published in Lancet, it's an honor.

900
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:09,324
It's a very high bar.

901
00:56:09,894 --> 00:56:13,464
And for it for a paper like
that to get all the way through

902
00:56:13,914 --> 00:56:15,564
and get published on Lancet...

903
00:56:15,714 --> 00:56:19,734
We talk about reviewers, associate
editor, people checking the data.

904
00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:22,074
Like, where did this data come from?

905
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:26,274
And then all the way to editorial
decision, gets published quickly.

906
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:29,814
Quickly! So it's not like it got
published two years later, it's quickly.

907
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:35,284
And then gets out there, that actually put a
chill on things. And as that happened in 2020,

908
00:56:35,484 --> 00:56:37,314
with some of the
mixed inpatient data

909
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:44,884
our FDA revoked the inpatient
use of hydroxychloroquine

910
00:56:45,384 --> 00:56:47,754
and then just put out a
general broad warning:

911
00:56:48,684 --> 00:56:51,624
Do not use hydroxychloroquine
in COVID-19.

912
00:56:51,649 --> 00:56:55,164
- Let me ask this: so that paper got
retracted and they still never explained

913
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:57,804
why they retracted, they just said the paper is retracted?
- Right.

914
00:56:57,984 --> 00:57:01,674
- So [...] obviously they found
something wrong with the data.

915
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:04,554
Whether it was fraudulent,
whether it was calculated...

916
00:57:04,743 --> 00:57:07,384
If they found something wrong that
somehow got through peer review.

917
00:57:07,884 --> 00:57:11,364
But yet that paper was used
to create all these other edicts.

918
00:57:11,724 --> 00:57:16,614
So it's kind of like they started from a false
premise and then making policy on it, it sounds like.

919
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:18,804
- Well, and there was
a lot of pile on editorials.

920
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:22,524
So editorials came
out - lessons learned!

921
00:57:23,454 --> 00:57:26,883
You know, hydroxychloroquine
is bad [...] there are papers...

922
00:57:26,923 --> 00:57:29,129
- Were you getting vilified at this
point because you've published it?

923
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,328
- No, not [neccesarily], this
was coming on the summary:

924
00:57:31,464 --> 00:57:39,114
The toxicity of hydroxychloroquine,
oh, it causes heart problems and [...]

925
00:57:39,324 --> 00:57:43,224
We were look and say: [guys] we would use this drug
for sixty five years, it wasn't too toxic.

926
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:48,114
Last year, we used it in our lupus and rheumatoid
patients and other rheumatologic diseases.

927
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:50,782
Why did it suddenly
take on this toxicity?

928
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:53,484
Part of the concern was,
when used in sick patients

929
00:57:54,324 --> 00:57:58,314
They... cardiac interval that's related
to lethal rhythms called the QT interval.

930
00:57:58,704 --> 00:58:02,604
That there is a predictable lengthening
of the QT interval with hydroxychloroquine.

931
00:58:03,114 --> 00:58:06,474
And it is conceivable in the environment of
multiple drugs or [other] things that the drug

932
00:58:06,474 --> 00:58:09,024
itself could have lead
to death. It's conceivable.

933
00:58:09,924 --> 00:58:13,614
So we published a paper during this
period time, separate paper, on a case.

934
00:58:13,884 --> 00:58:17,244
So a case at our hospitals published in The
American Journal of Cardiology of a woman.

935
00:58:18,024 --> 00:58:19,927
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00"> [intensive care unit]</font>

936
00:58:18,024 --> 00:58:19,927
Very sick with
COVID-19 in the ICU

937
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:22,824
and she develops one of these
characteristic arrhythmias.

938
00:58:23,636 --> 00:58:24,984
That we see with prolonged QT

939
00:58:25,344 --> 00:58:29,034
and it's called Torsades de Pointes which
[...] it means twisting around a point.

940
00:58:29,754 --> 00:58:34,014
And this is the classic picture
that if one were to claim

941
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:38,694
that hydroxychloroquine was killing patients,
this was the classic picture of the case

942
00:58:38,754 --> 00:58:42,054
and we published it [...]
except for one important point

943
00:58:42,444 --> 00:58:45,454
she didn't receive a milligram
of hydroxychloroquine.

944
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,794
So it's the milieu [context]
of being sick with COVID-19.

945
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:53,844
That was the point of the paper [say],
listen, people can develop QT prolongation,

946
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:55,734
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">[abnormal heart rhythm that
can lead to sudden cardiac death]</font>

947
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:55,734
they can develop
"Torsades de pointes".

948
00:58:56,124 --> 00:58:57,384
[Be]cause they
are sick in the ICU

949
00:58:57,654 --> 00:59:01,104
And this like [...] two are unrelated. It
just was not related to hydroxychloroquine.

950
00:59:01,129 --> 00:59:02,904
And subsequent really
good studies done

951
00:59:03,924 --> 00:59:05,964
and published in
cardiology journals, showed

952
00:59:06,324 --> 00:59:09,534
that there, yes, there was this predictable
lengthening of hydroxychloroquine

953
00:59:09,714 --> 00:59:13,614
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">[magnetic resonance imaging]</font>

954
00:59:09,714 --> 00:59:13,614
doctors can easily management, make decisions,
we have patients on the cardiac [MRI?]

955
00:59:13,914 --> 00:59:18,755
There was no excess uncontrolled
toxicity of hydroxychloroquine.

956
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,204
So that basically settled
out through the year or so.

957
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,084
We didn't really, if
you recall through 2020,

958
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:27,930
that clamor, that hydroxychloroquine
was dangerous, was settled down.

959
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:29,724
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">[American Medical Association]</font>

960
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:29,724
I mean, there was a
backlash, you know, the AMA

961
00:59:29,886 --> 00:59:31,836
said [...] don't use
hydroxychloroquine

962
00:59:32,004 --> 00:59:34,554
the AMA actually never opines
on whether or not to use drugs

963
00:59:34,764 --> 00:59:38,244
now the FDA can [...] put out a
warning there's tons of FDA warnings.

964
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,994
Almost all the diabetes drugs have warnings
for pancreatitis, for instance, you know.

965
00:59:42,324 --> 00:59:45,804
It's not a showstopper, we still treat
diabetes, but we recognize some warnings.

966
00:59:46,074 --> 00:59:51,034
So the FDA warning about it
wasn't such a big deal, I mean.

967
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,374
Yeah, we always
respect the FDA judgment.

968
00:59:54,114 --> 00:59:55,284
But with AMA coming out...

969
00:59:55,506 --> 00:59:57,519
Why are they opining on this drug?
- [...] strange, yeah.

970
00:59:57,544 --> 01:00:02,874
- They not a drug society, they are doctors advocacy
site, but then that spread to the pharmacy boards.

971
01:00:03,054 --> 01:00:06,654
And then there were reports that the pharmacist said,
listen, we're not going to give hydroxychloroquine.

972
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:08,724
- And that was, yes, I've seen
that they wouldn't fill prescriptions.

973
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:10,494
From a regulatory standpoint,

974
01:00:11,064 --> 01:00:14,874
can't you prescribe something off label? I
mean do you really need the FDA's permission

975
01:00:14,874 --> 01:00:16,584
anyway [...]

976
01:00:16,704 --> 01:00:20,244
Isn't it your purview as a doctor? Say, I have
a license, I have a plenary license, I can write

977
01:00:20,244 --> 01:00:24,054
prescriptions and if in my judgment I want
to give this drug to this patient for an off

978
01:00:24,114 --> 01:00:27,444
label, meaning, you know, not for it
[but as I understand] "off label" meaning

979
01:00:27,804 --> 01:00:29,634
for something other
than was approved for.

980
01:00:29,784 --> 01:00:34,614
[...] That's regular practice, a lot of
drugs are given off label every single day.

981
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:40,274
Then you don't really need anybody's
permission to prescribe hydroxychloroquine

982
01:00:40,299 --> 01:00:44,154
you know, for Covid case if you wanted to
or even prophylactically for that matter.

983
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:53,604
- Sure this was the first time where the fiduciary relationship
that circle between the patient and the doctor or the

984
01:00:53,604 --> 01:00:56,634
healthcare provider, could be
physician assistant or nurse practitioner,

985
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,354
where that was violated.

986
01:00:59,244 --> 01:01:02,224
That's a really sanctimonious
relationship, boy.

987
01:01:02,514 --> 01:01:05,844
You get into an exam room with your doctor,
you get on the phone with your doctor.

988
01:01:06,774 --> 01:01:08,274
I mean, there's malpractice.

989
01:01:08,604 --> 01:01:12,384
There's your life is on the line, the
doctor's responsible, the doctor has to use

990
01:01:12,504 --> 01:01:15,654
his or her full and best
judgment and you're right

991
01:01:15,894 --> 01:01:19,396
they have to use their full and best
judgment for the use of all drugs.

992
01:01:19,746 --> 01:01:25,356
Now the label is always applied
for by the pharmaceutical company

993
01:01:25,686 --> 01:01:29,196
in order to make advertising claims
sometimes we say it's an advertising label.

994
01:01:29,616 --> 01:01:33,876
So the advertising label, the original
advertising label, of a drug is completely

995
01:01:33,876 --> 01:01:35,466
irrelevant to it's future uses.

996
01:01:35,736 --> 01:01:38,556
Every one agrees upon
that, so there is some giant

997
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:41,316
fraction of all
use of drugs that

998
01:01:41,766 --> 01:01:45,216
is not on the original advertising label
because new uses come forward for,

999
01:01:45,516 --> 01:01:49,026
including common diuretics and
steroids and we can go on and on.

1000
01:01:49,051 --> 01:01:51,726
And some huge estimate,
let's say more than half,

1001
01:01:52,356 --> 01:01:57,156
of all drugs are prescribed off the original
advertising label, which is perfectly fine.

1002
01:01:57,396 --> 01:02:02,436
What we agree upon is the important point
of the label is the safety information.

1003
01:02:02,706 --> 01:02:06,486
The safety information should apply to
all applications and with COVID-19

1004
01:02:07,386 --> 01:02:12,246
it did need interpretation and application to
sick patients with COVID-19, that was fair.

1005
01:02:12,606 --> 01:02:19,816
And to our knowledge we were very thoughtful about that
in our first American Journal of Medicine publication.

1006
01:02:19,926 --> 01:02:26,436
But as things unfolded, I responded to
Peter Navarro. I helped organize a team

1007
01:02:26,946 --> 01:02:31,686
to work, to actually reestablish
the emergency use authorization.

1008
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:35,226
And try to broaden it for
outpatient use in order to

1009
01:02:35,736 --> 01:02:37,686
be able to continue
our research without

1010
01:02:37,866 --> 01:02:41,106
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">[Emergency Use Authorization]</font>

1011
01:02:37,866 --> 01:02:41,106
having to have investigational drug
applications. If we actually had a broad EUA

1012
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:42,756
[for] outpatient,
potentially, that would work.

1013
01:02:43,476 --> 01:02:44,526
That was not approved.

1014
01:02:45,396 --> 01:02:51,276
And then things started to move in rapid
cycle. I was contacted by sen. Ron Johnson.

1015
01:02:52,176 --> 01:02:56,415
There was some interchange about YouTube videos.
I had never been on social media before.

1016
01:02:56,449 --> 01:03:02,166
I always had a very inactive Twitter
account based at my position at Baylor.

1017
01:03:02,496 --> 01:03:03,496
That I just posted

1018
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:07,086
very very rarely something maybe I was
at a meeting but I mean I would probably I

1019
01:03:07,097 --> 01:03:08,856
have less than one
post a month just.

1020
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:14,956
And then I had a LinkedIn profile that
was very unused as well as pretty static.

1021
01:03:15,246 --> 01:03:21,186
And I never really posted on social media but,
[you know,] I was encouraged by sen Ron Johnson.

1022
01:03:21,606 --> 01:03:23,142
as well as some
family members to say:

1023
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:27,156
"Listen this is an important message we're in a
crisis people don't know about treatment.

1024
01:03:27,876 --> 01:03:29,346
You've got a published paper."

1025
01:03:29,526 --> 01:03:32,667
It looks like those who were
downloading the paper, that it was useful.

1026
01:03:32,691 --> 01:03:34,236
I was getting a lot
of positive feedback.

1027
01:03:34,626 --> 01:03:36,546
So I made some YouTube videos.

1028
01:03:36,876 --> 01:03:40,506
I can't remember all the details
but I know after some uptake

1029
01:03:40,626 --> 01:03:43,836
and some of them are just scientific, I wear
a suit and tie like this and I presented

1030
01:03:43,836 --> 01:03:45,936
like four slides just
explaining them.

1031
01:03:46,896 --> 01:03:48,486
Nothing unseemly in them.

1032
01:03:48,846 --> 01:03:52,536
I contracted COVID-19 myself in
October so I did make a YouTube video about

1033
01:03:52,776 --> 01:03:57,486
what I did. I was in an
FDA approved protocol.

1034
01:03:57,846 --> 01:03:59,812
Out of a lab in California.

1035
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,426
I did take hydroxychloroquine and
drugs and sequence combination, I signed

1036
01:04:03,426 --> 01:04:07,632
consent. I submitted all my samples.
So, you know, I did the right thing.

1037
01:04:07,657 --> 01:04:10,817
I mean, we want people to be
involved in COVID-19 research.

1038
01:04:11,706 --> 01:04:15,336
That completes part one of my three
part interview with dr Peter McCullough.

1039
01:04:15,636 --> 01:04:21,346
I am really excited to have you see these next
two parts that are coming up later in the series.

1040
01:04:21,546 --> 01:04:22,546
See you there.

1041
01:04:32,856 --> 01:04:36,516
Well, right now you're in for a treat. Next
up is part one of my two part interview

1042
01:04:36,546 --> 01:04:37,566
with Del Bigtree.

1043
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:40,589
Del Bigtree is the
founder and also the

1044
01:04:40,614 --> 01:04:43,056
host of the Highwire
and I have to tell you

1045
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,326
the Highwire has been
doing an extraordinary job

1046
01:04:46,626 --> 01:04:50,526
of exposing the lies
and misperceptions

1047
01:04:50,796 --> 01:04:53,466
and disinformation
when it comes to Covid

1048
01:04:53,796 --> 01:04:58,506
and it has bravely told the truth,
interviewed people and brought it out publicly

1049
01:04:58,806 --> 01:05:01,746
in ways that very few other people
are doing right now in the world.

1050
01:05:02,046 --> 01:05:06,606
Del's passion, his intelligence
and his ability to get to the truth

1051
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:09,336
is something that the
world needs right now

1052
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:13,716
and I am happy that he came
to our series to be able to share

1053
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:16,296
what he's been finding out
when it comes to Covid so

1054
01:05:16,506 --> 01:05:19,061
enjoy part one
of this interview right now.

1055
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:25,746
Del Bigtree I'm really excited for this
interview. I've been anticipating it because

1056
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:28,326
I follow the
Highwire very closely

1057
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:31,596
it's really one of the best places
I get my information from too.

1058
01:05:31,956 --> 01:05:33,306
Keep myself updated

1059
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:36,186
and you're [...] certainly making
some waves and attracting

1060
01:05:36,336 --> 01:05:39,816
some attention because of how
deep you've been [...] diving into this

1061
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:44,256
subject of Covid and everything
that there is surrounding it.

1062
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:48,252
And the [...] people that you've
been interviewing for the Highwire and

1063
01:05:48,276 --> 01:05:50,076
a depth that you'd been
going into it has been

1064
01:05:50,226 --> 01:05:52,896
admirable so [...] thank
you for taking the time to

1065
01:05:53,016 --> 01:05:54,786
share what you've
been doing with us.

1066
01:05:54,906 --> 01:05:57,625
- Patrick I'm looking forward
to it too. It's always great to do

1067
01:05:57,726 --> 01:06:01,956
these interviews with you so I'm looking forward
to see what, you know, [...] where this all goes.

1068
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:04,327
I'm sure it will be a good place.

1069
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:07,956
But let's [...] just start, if we can, with
your background, so people understand how

1070
01:06:07,956 --> 01:06:10,325
you got to be doing, you
know, what you're doing

1071
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:13,176
because you had a background
in TV and TV production

1072
01:06:13,656 --> 01:06:19,176
and then suddenly, here you are, with your [...]
own show that's become hugely popular, the Highwire.

1073
01:06:19,746 --> 01:06:24,645
{\an3}But how did you get here?
- So [when] I started out really my goal was to be a filmmaker.

1074
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:29,689
{\an3}I landed in Los Angeles and I'd written screenplays
and I was sort of moving in that direction

1075
01:06:29,713 --> 01:06:33,756
but as fate would have it, you
know, all of that shifted really.

1076
01:06:34,026 --> 01:06:36,216
Looking back now,
the benefit of hindsight,

1077
01:06:36,486 --> 01:06:40,746
when a friend of mine called and said, hey
Del, I know you know how to shoot camera

1078
01:06:40,806 --> 01:06:45,069
and [...] we need an extra
videographer on the dr Phil show.

1079
01:06:45,093 --> 01:06:46,730
It was like this
Love Smart Island.

1080
01:06:46,754 --> 01:06:51,336
It was like a whole weekend on and on
Catalina island, could you do it? I said sure.

1081
01:06:52,146 --> 01:06:56,016
That changed my life forever. I didn't know
it at the moment, but you'd always there I

1082
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:57,966
was a just a backup
camera person

1083
01:06:58,176 --> 01:07:01,926
somebody said, look, that couples arguing
over there, why don't you run over and

1084
01:07:02,346 --> 01:07:05,586
do an interview real quick, can you
just... we don't have any produces around

1085
01:07:05,886 --> 01:07:09,816
so I did and it went well and the next thing
I knew I was traveling all over the country

1086
01:07:09,816 --> 01:07:10,926
for dr Phil

1087
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:15,366
interviewing families and, you know, people going
through these crazy situations in their lives

1088
01:07:15,606 --> 01:07:20,016
and then the dr Phil show created
[...] this show called "the Doctors" and

1089
01:07:20,676 --> 01:07:25,086
I was brought, you know, I was sort of teamed
up with this brand new executive producer

1090
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:26,856
that was going
to attempt to turn

1091
01:07:27,156 --> 01:07:33,066
medicine and, you know,
disease into daytime television

1092
01:07:33,486 --> 01:07:37,446
And we did. And so through
that job and sort of setting that up I

1093
01:07:37,656 --> 01:07:40,056
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">[operating rooms]</font>

1094
01:07:37,656 --> 01:07:40,056
started scrubbing into ORs and

1095
01:07:40,296 --> 01:07:42,336
shooting surgeries and then

1096
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:44,796
doing stories about cutting
edge techniques and so

1097
01:07:45,066 --> 01:07:50,346
that I was on that show "the Doctors"
producing for six years. I won an Emmy award.

1098
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:55,116
Doing it and it was amazing, you
know, really because I had never

1099
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:59,233
really been to a
doctor in my life.

1100
01:07:59,257 --> 01:08:01,116
My mom would call me and say:

1101
01:08:01,446 --> 01:08:05,406
Del what are you doing working on a medical talk
show, you've never been to a doctor in your life.

1102
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:09,246
And I said, I don't know, it's a
really weird journey I'm on here

1103
01:08:09,606 --> 01:08:13,026
but I actually enjoy
it and I've found that

1104
01:08:13,386 --> 01:08:17,406
as I was, you know, producing these shows
about science and medicine, I was reading more

1105
01:08:17,406 --> 01:08:20,046
and more medical journals
and peer reviewed studies and

1106
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:23,886
you know, breaking stories
on science and health

1107
01:08:24,276 --> 01:08:27,606
and I remember once like looking at this
reading through this medical journal, which

1108
01:08:27,606 --> 01:08:30,846
at that point was still about half of it
seemed like it was in Chinese and we all

1109
01:08:30,846 --> 01:08:31,416
have to admit

1110
01:08:31,656 --> 01:08:35,626
you know, you sit there like looking up the big
words trying to beat them but I got the idea.

1111
01:08:35,775 --> 01:08:39,276
But I'm sitting there reading this
medical journal and [...] thinking

1112
01:08:39,486 --> 01:08:42,996
man, I wish I could go back
back to my 18 year old self and say

1113
01:08:43,206 --> 01:08:46,266
in your future you are going
to be reading medical journals.

1114
01:08:47,226 --> 01:08:51,916
But I found a passion for it
and so that was what I was doing

1115
01:08:52,206 --> 01:08:56,556
and you know I actually was interviewing
Zach Bush, who I know you know, and Zach

1116
01:08:56,796 --> 01:08:59,736
when I interviewed him, I said how did you
get here and he talked about how he might

1117
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:02,376
have ended up being a
mechanic or maybe an engineer

1118
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:06,726
until the accidentally ended up working with
his aunt, who was a midwife for a summer

1119
01:09:06,996 --> 01:09:10,056
and then realized, oh my god,
I've got this passion in medicine.

1120
01:09:10,296 --> 01:09:14,376
I feel very much the same way that had
this all happened earlier, I probably would

1121
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:17,076
have gone to med school, had
my parents ever sent me to a doctor

1122
01:09:17,226 --> 01:09:19,746
who knows, maybe I'd
be a doctor right now [...].

1123
01:09:20,076 --> 01:09:23,766
So there was a real passion there and
then while I was working on "the Doctors"

1124
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:27,486
I got tipped off by an
inside source that said that

1125
01:09:27,726 --> 01:09:30,461
there was going to be a
whistleblower coming forward inside of

1126
01:09:30,485 --> 01:09:32,496
the centers for disease
control and prevention

1127
01:09:33,246 --> 01:09:36,336
named doctor William
Thompson and that he was going to

1128
01:09:36,816 --> 01:09:40,026
put up proof that they were
committing scientific fraud

1129
01:09:40,236 --> 01:09:42,996
on the vaccines safety
studies and specifically

1130
01:09:43,206 --> 01:09:47,076
the MMR, the measles mumps
rubella, study that looked at autism

1131
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,496
done by the CDC between 2000 and 2004.

1132
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:55,476
So I went as I always did when I had a
breaking story like that to the executive

1133
01:09:55,476 --> 01:09:58,216
producers of "the
Doctors" and I said, look,

1134
01:09:58,776 --> 01:10:03,096
I don't know if this story is going to pan
out or not but I have a lead and the jump on a

1135
01:10:03,096 --> 01:10:05,406
story I don't think anyone
of the nation knows about

1136
01:10:05,646 --> 01:10:08,446
there's going to be a whistleblower
at the CDC that's going to say that

1137
01:10:08,736 --> 01:10:11,346
they're committing scientific
fraud on the vaccine safety studies.

1138
01:10:12,006 --> 01:10:16,716
My executive producers that normally would
go just about anywhere I wanted to go with

1139
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:17,736
with the show I mean

1140
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:21,216
I produced one episode every
week there's about seven producers

1141
01:10:21,486 --> 01:10:25,326
but I rated so high, my
shows did so well, normally

1142
01:10:25,536 --> 01:10:28,626
I didn't really have to fight for the
stories I want to do but in this case

1143
01:10:28,866 --> 01:10:32,376
they're like Del are you crazy
we are not going to attack the CDC

1144
01:10:32,586 --> 01:10:36,756
who leads us behind the scenes everytime
there's a flu outbreak to show the pandemonium

1145
01:10:36,906 --> 01:10:40,266
we're not going to go after
Merck who's, you know, a sponsor

1146
01:10:40,596 --> 01:10:45,666
of this show, and, you know, what does all
the commercials and stuff during our breaks.

1147
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:48,023
So let this one alone and...

1148
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,916
I couldn't. I couldn't
let go of that story

1149
01:10:51,246 --> 01:10:54,846
and so through [...] a
miraculous set of circumstances

1150
01:10:55,086 --> 01:10:59,076
I ended up teaming up with doctor
Andrew Wakefield who was already

1151
01:10:59,796 --> 01:11:02,166
making a documentary
about this story

1152
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:06,666
and we created the documentary
"VAXXED From Cover-Up to Catastrophe".

1153
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:11,046
Which I think swept the world by
storm and really threw me in the middle

1154
01:11:11,286 --> 01:11:12,666
of this conversation.

1155
01:11:12,906 --> 01:11:18,516
- Yeah, and what's fascinating and I'm
wondering what went through your mind when

1156
01:11:19,056 --> 01:11:21,936
they said [you know]
listen [...] this is [...]

1157
01:11:22,428 --> 01:11:27,618
a real story, but we can't run it for commercial
reasons. What was your, like, response

1158
01:11:27,618 --> 01:11:31,758
to that because I think a lot of what's going
on now [yeah] that was the first whiff of

1159
01:11:31,758 --> 01:11:33,198
censorship that you got saying

1160
01:11:33,438 --> 01:11:38,208
oh this, yeah, we can't talk about this.
- Well to be honest you're always dealing with

1161
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:42,528
some censorship, right? It's not
lost on anyone inside of media.

1162
01:11:42,978 --> 01:11:47,388
You know, who's funding the work that you're
doing, you know, you [...] only have to step

1163
01:11:47,388 --> 01:11:50,088
on, you know, that
third rail once or twice

1164
01:11:50,358 --> 01:11:53,988
before you go "oh I just don't go
near these types of stories" and

1165
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:59,598
you know, so I wasn't shocked I, you know,
that they [...] didn't want to do the story.

1166
01:12:00,378 --> 01:12:04,938
It's to be expected and there's a way
that it said where you just know there's no

1167
01:12:04,938 --> 01:12:06,198
pushing back here

1168
01:12:06,468 --> 01:12:09,408
this is going nowhere and
so that was the meeting.

1169
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:14,091
But, you know, [...] what I
think what shocked me the

1170
01:12:14,116 --> 01:12:17,874
most was not that we
wouldn't do the story.

1171
01:12:17,898 --> 01:12:22,308
I had assumed that since this
was such a big breaking story

1172
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:24,378
[...] and no matter
how you told it, right?

1173
01:12:24,558 --> 01:12:28,098
Either you really do have a whistleblower
that's showing that they have committed

1174
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:29,178
scientific fraud on

1175
01:12:29,508 --> 01:12:32,208
very important safety studies
that would affect our children

1176
01:12:32,358 --> 01:12:36,048
or you're doing a story on the
fact that they need to do better

1177
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:39,708
job at human resources at the
CDC because they have a lunatic

1178
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:43,758
working there that is
spreading lies. But either way

1179
01:12:43,878 --> 01:12:45,978
it's a big story
and so I figured

1180
01:12:46,188 --> 01:12:49,938
you know, Fox and
CNN and MSNBC and NBC

1181
01:12:50,178 --> 01:12:53,808
they're going to jump on the story
New York Times and then once they do

1182
01:12:54,018 --> 01:12:56,478
I'll go back to my executive
producers and say well

1183
01:12:56,748 --> 01:13:00,408
now that this is a big medical story why
don't we give the doctor's perspective and

1184
01:13:00,408 --> 01:13:03,768
let me do that. So I thought I was
still going to get an end of the story

1185
01:13:03,978 --> 01:13:05,881
I just wasn't going to
get to break the story,

1186
01:13:05,905 --> 01:13:07,908
which is sort of what you
want to do as a journalist.

1187
01:13:08,058 --> 01:13:11,418
What shocked me was when
no one in media covered it,

1188
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:14,118
you know, two weeks
later just as I was told

1189
01:13:14,328 --> 01:13:16,924
these recorded interviews
of this whistleblower

1190
01:13:16,949 --> 01:13:18,468
came out and he
was saying things like

1191
01:13:18,678 --> 01:13:21,378
everytime I see a child
with autism I feel guilty.

1192
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:25,758
We hid statistically significant
information from this study

1193
01:13:26,058 --> 01:13:27,588
you know, and I
[...] just thought

1194
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:30,918
this is huge and
no one's covering it.

1195
01:13:31,428 --> 01:13:33,048
In fact even CNN

1196
01:13:33,228 --> 01:13:35,645
had at that time this
"I-Report" where people

1197
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:37,728
could just put up
reports in their local area

1198
01:13:37,938 --> 01:13:42,408
and someone put up whistleblower inside of
the CDC and it came down almost immediately

1199
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:46,330
And that I think was the
most shocking moment

1200
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:49,848
because I think I knew
that my medical talk show

1201
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:54,438
was being funded and essentially
produced by the pharmaceutical industry.

1202
01:13:54,828 --> 01:14:01,188
That's the moment I realized all of television is
being controlled by the pharmaceutical industry

1203
01:14:01,578 --> 01:14:03,768
and that was the
shocking moment for me.

1204
01:14:04,098 --> 01:14:08,448
- Yeah and there's relevance here,
you know, as we fast forward because

1205
01:14:08,838 --> 01:14:11,448
the trust that we're
putting into the CDC,

1206
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:14,208
you know, which has this
history that you just described.

1207
01:14:15,108 --> 01:14:19,278
You know, as far as saying hey we can trust
what's coming out of there and we have to

1208
01:14:19,338 --> 01:14:23,808
remake society basically
based on what the CDC is saying

1209
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:28,248
and people don't really understand
that it's a very flawed organization.

1210
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:31,938
So, I think that backdrop is
very relevant to this conversation.

1211
01:14:32,448 --> 01:14:36,498
- Well it absolutely is and I think
it's the hardest part of the work that

1212
01:14:36,574 --> 01:14:39,688
[you know] people
like you and I do.

1213
01:14:39,978 --> 01:14:45,828
Which is trying to get through to
people that these agencies and these

1214
01:14:46,008 --> 01:14:48,948
icons, like Tony Fauci

1215
01:14:49,308 --> 01:14:54,678
that you have sort of been raised
to trust are really are not trustworthy.

1216
01:14:55,218 --> 01:14:58,758
And so when we find ourselves in the
middle of the pandemic and we're being told

1217
01:14:58,758 --> 01:15:02,028
people are dying all over the
world and we've got to save our

1218
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:03,558
brothers and sisters

1219
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:09,498
[you know] we think most people think, I mean,
that must be true, who would lie about that and

1220
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:13,128
you know, and then when we find
out from those same sources that

1221
01:15:13,338 --> 01:15:18,046
you know, hydroxychloroquine doesn't work and
ivermectin doesn't work and budesonide doesn't work

1222
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:21,198
we think, well that
must be true, why would

1223
01:15:21,498 --> 01:15:26,238
you know, the head of a health department
or the head of the NIH or why would the CDC

1224
01:15:26,508 --> 01:15:29,868
you know, keep me from taking
a product if it works and then

1225
01:15:30,048 --> 01:15:34,038
if they tell me the vaccine works, certainly
it must work, if they tell me it's safe

1226
01:15:34,278 --> 01:15:35,298
it must be safe.

1227
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:40,728
I mean, but what we don't realize is really
what's behind the scenes of how all the decisions

1228
01:15:40,938 --> 01:15:43,668
have been made and that's
been the journey that I've been on

1229
01:15:44,268 --> 01:15:46,998
for this last five years,
since I made VAXXED and

1230
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:51,408
basically kissed my television
career goodbye, because I offended

1231
01:15:51,528 --> 01:15:55,938
all of those entities that, you
know, make television possible.

1232
01:15:56,928 --> 01:16:01,368
But my investigation was really into
how are these decisions being made

1233
01:16:01,488 --> 01:16:03,978
where does the CDC
get their information.

1234
01:16:04,428 --> 01:16:06,948
From instance, I think
we're all under the impression

1235
01:16:07,218 --> 01:16:08,688
at least I was that

1236
01:16:08,868 --> 01:16:12,918
when we hear about safety studies
being done on drugs or vaccines

1237
01:16:13,158 --> 01:16:16,938
I always thought the FDA was
doing those studies. I always thought

1238
01:16:17,118 --> 01:16:20,508
you know, we have billions of
dollars funneling through the NIH

1239
01:16:20,688 --> 01:16:22,608
if there's a new product
that's going to come out

1240
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:26,028
the FDA puts its team
of top scientists and

1241
01:16:26,298 --> 01:16:30,137
Tony Fauci is in there and they're running
studies to make sure this is safe before it

1242
01:16:30,137 --> 01:16:31,137
goes out to the public

1243
01:16:31,188 --> 01:16:33,948
I really didn't know that
they never do the studies.

1244
01:16:34,218 --> 01:16:38,058
I didn't know that every study on
safety that we're being told about

1245
01:16:38,268 --> 01:16:40,548
is being done by
the manufacturer

1246
01:16:40,698 --> 01:16:43,458
that's going to make billions
of dollars from the product

1247
01:16:43,848 --> 01:16:46,098
and that the FDA and CDC

1248
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:48,168
basically just take
their word for it.

1249
01:16:48,378 --> 01:16:52,398
When they say, oh, it was really
safe and we love our outcome.

1250
01:16:52,698 --> 01:16:56,358
We just go, "oh, great!" which
I find that shocking, right?

1251
01:16:56,628 --> 01:17:00,858
You wouldn't do that with a car, we don't
do that with cars, like, [...] we still take

1252
01:17:01,068 --> 01:17:06,348
cars and, you know, have independent laboratories
that do crash tests and make sure that

1253
01:17:06,618 --> 01:17:09,888
you know, I know you love the car
that you've made, but how safe is it

1254
01:17:10,248 --> 01:17:14,988
[...] I assume that was taking place with drugs
and vaccines and [...] nothing can be really

1255
01:17:14,988 --> 01:17:16,068
further from the truth

1256
01:17:16,338 --> 01:17:20,778
the industry itself loves it's product, it
wants to make billions, it tells the FDA and

1257
01:17:20,778 --> 01:17:21,798
CDC it's safe

1258
01:17:22,008 --> 01:17:24,498
the FDA and CDC sort
of rubber stamp that

1259
01:17:24,768 --> 01:17:28,728
and just to give just a moment of proof to
that, because I know it's really hard for

1260
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:29,728
people to hear that.

1261
01:17:30,498 --> 01:17:34,818
Because this is in many ways is [...]
I think the easier way to understand

1262
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:38,328
how we look at mainstream
medicine and the CDC and the FDA

1263
01:17:38,538 --> 01:17:43,488
is to consider it more like a religion, it's really
much more like a religion than it is a science.

1264
01:17:43,698 --> 01:17:47,088
We don't sit down and read...
How many people have read the

1265
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:51,318
emergency use authorization of the
Pfizer vaccine or the Moderna vaccine

1266
01:17:51,828 --> 01:17:52,698
before they got it?

1267
01:17:52,818 --> 01:17:55,968
I would guess, you
know, probably 0.002%

1268
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:57,978
or something like that. I read it.

1269
01:17:58,398 --> 01:18:03,588
And if you read it, it's really quite shocking
how little they know about what it does

1270
01:18:03,918 --> 01:18:08,358
but for people that think well somebody's
reading it the doctors are reading it, no

1271
01:18:08,358 --> 01:18:11,418
they're not. Doctors do not
read it, nurses do not read it.

1272
01:18:11,718 --> 01:18:14,838
In fact, you know, they know
less about these products

1273
01:18:15,048 --> 01:18:19,848
then really at this point your average
mother with an autistic child or a mother

1274
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:23,238
of someone that has a someone in
their family has an autoimmune disease

1275
01:18:23,388 --> 01:18:26,298
Once it's in your
family the recognition

1276
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:29,328
that you have a
sensitive body system,

1277
01:18:29,598 --> 01:18:34,008
those parents do more investigation and
reading and understand the science better

1278
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:36,228
than almost any
pediatrician I've ever met

1279
01:18:36,528 --> 01:18:39,918
and almost any doctor I've
ever met, but to make that clear

1280
01:18:40,188 --> 01:18:43,128
because I know people going,
you know, that's preposterous

1281
01:18:43,338 --> 01:18:47,658
How do you think it is that we
had drugs like let's say Vioxx

1282
01:18:47,988 --> 01:18:49,818
[...] you know, that kills

1283
01:18:49,968 --> 01:18:53,508
you know, over 100 000 people
before it's pulled from the shelves?

1284
01:18:53,778 --> 01:18:55,458
How is it that that happens

1285
01:18:55,728 --> 01:19:00,738
if doctors read the science, if the, you
know, if the CDC is doing the safety studies?

1286
01:19:00,738 --> 01:19:03,888
They're not! So the
CDC said Vioxx was safe.

1287
01:19:04,518 --> 01:19:06,768
The FDA said Vioxx was safe

1288
01:19:06,948 --> 01:19:08,748
and how did they
determine it was safe

1289
01:19:08,898 --> 01:19:13,583
because they were told, that it
was safe by Merck I believe it was.

1290
01:19:13,607 --> 01:19:16,068
And so Merck says
our studies look great

1291
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:20,148
now when they get sued
and we take them to court

1292
01:19:20,298 --> 01:19:24,228
that's when we get discovery and
recognize, oh my god, you guys knew this

1293
01:19:24,408 --> 01:19:26,208
caused heart attacks
all the way back

1294
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:28,728
in your phase one
trial and phase two trials

1295
01:19:28,878 --> 01:19:32,238
only you hid that from the
FDA, you hid that from the CDC.

1296
01:19:32,478 --> 01:19:35,238
This is happening over
and over and over again

1297
01:19:35,508 --> 01:19:38,448
More recently was
a talcum powder.

1298
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:40,608
Johnson and
Johnson's baby powder

1299
01:19:40,878 --> 01:19:45,468
We now know after they've paid out billions
of dollars in legal [...] settlements

1300
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:48,048
that they all always
knew it had asbestos in it.

1301
01:19:48,258 --> 01:19:50,868
That the removal of
talc from mountainsides,

1302
01:19:51,018 --> 01:19:54,918
it was impossible. It tends to be right
next to where you would find asbestos.

1303
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:58,098
They never told anybody.
It's in all of their studies.

1304
01:19:58,308 --> 01:20:01,188
And when we finally sued and
went back and said you mean

1305
01:20:01,308 --> 01:20:05,072
when we've been sprinkling this powder on
our naked babies when they've come out of

1306
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:07,878
their bath that you always
knew it had asbestos?

1307
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:11,668
And [...] CDC and doctors and,

1308
01:20:11,868 --> 01:20:15,438
you know, how many pediatricians said this
is a great way to [...] keep your baby dry

1309
01:20:15,438 --> 01:20:17,407
or mothers that were
coming out of showers using

1310
01:20:17,432 --> 01:20:19,818
that shower to shower
each day product and

1311
01:20:20,058 --> 01:20:21,858
did you know
that once it started

1312
01:20:22,098 --> 01:20:25,949
you know, that educated people are
starting to recognize it had asbestos,

1313
01:20:26,058 --> 01:20:30,888
that "Johnson & Johnson" move their
advertising to try and find populations

1314
01:20:31,158 --> 01:20:34,248
of ethnicity to push
the product there?

1315
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:39,138
These are the same companies that are
making the vaccines that we're talking about

1316
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:43,218
today - Johnson & Johnson,
Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis.

1317
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:45,108
This is how they work

1318
01:20:45,378 --> 01:20:50,088
and this is what people need to understand
when they try to, you know, decide

1319
01:20:50,268 --> 01:20:52,160
am I just going to take
my doctor's word for

1320
01:20:52,185 --> 01:20:54,564
them or am I going to
do my own research.

1321
01:20:54,588 --> 01:20:56,538
- You erecting a lot of
great points as far as

1322
01:20:56,928 --> 01:21:01,908
misplaced trust and the fact that
there's huge conflicts of interest

1323
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:06,678
and [...] the other
thing is that people

1324
01:21:06,888 --> 01:21:11,418
in our governmental agencies end up
leaving those posts and getting very big fat

1325
01:21:11,508 --> 01:21:13,968
you know, consulting jobs
and board seats and so on,

1326
01:21:14,298 --> 01:21:17,388
in this same company so if they
play ball while they're in government

1327
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:20,149
they are writing their ticket
for when they leave government

1328
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:23,688
then they're taken care of and it's sort
of this unspoken thing that's going on

1329
01:21:24,108 --> 01:21:27,168
and that I think is a huge
things is why're we trusting

1330
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,900
on such a significant level

1331
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:32,300
these people who have
been convicted of fraud?

1332
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,820
I mean they've been fined
by our justice department.

1333
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:38,385
So and I think that that's
lost on most of the population.

1334
01:21:38,409 --> 01:21:42,968
You can't really get that out in
mainstream media. It's not happening.

1335
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:45,740
Now we come into Covid
and what I'm seeing

1336
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:53,030
is that there's this growing course of
extraordinarily well credentialed scientist

1337
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:56,840
[you know] academic, [...]
people in medicine, clinicians...

1338
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:02,790
And it [...] seems to be growing as
far as Covid the Covid vaccine and etc.

1339
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:05,930
And yet this is still
not making headlines.

1340
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:11,000
so what [...] do you see as far as our current
circumstance relative to Covid, the vaccine

1341
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:16,304
and do you think that a dam is going to break,
we're finally [...], it's just overwhelming.

1342
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:21,140
As far as the people who are shouting
this is insanity we have to change course?

1343
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:26,150
- Well, you already have the beginnings of
a dam break, right? It starts with a crack

1344
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,230
and the water starts flowing
through and then the bricks

1345
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,300
start falling apart

1346
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:33,470
and now you have homes that are flooding,
you know, all, you know, down the valley

1347
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:38,330
which is our nation and the world all of
the millions of people that are marching

1348
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:39,140
around the world

1349
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:43,730
are already being affected by these
lies and they know it's a lie and so

1350
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,470
we are watching, you know,

1351
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:48,230
the beginning of that
sort of dam break moment

1352
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:52,010
taking place right now
and it is it's fascinating.

1353
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:57,500
That I think it's [...] such a scary moment
with this vaccine and I want people to

1354
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,550
really think about that.

1355
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:01,430
I've been at this
for five years and

1356
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:06,350
I can't tell you how many scientists and
doctors I met while making [bucks] that would say

1357
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:11,690
Del I [...] believe that back... there is
a really good chance that vaccines are

1358
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:13,040
contributing to autism

1359
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:17,000
but I will never say that on a camera
because I will destroy my career

1360
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:21,290
I will lose [...] the work that I'm doing.
I'll be shut down at the university I'm at,

1361
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,410
and so I'm just not going to risk
all the great work that I'm doing

1362
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:26,570
to make that statement, I'm sorry.

1363
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:33,890
So when I'm seeing, you know, scientists at the
level that we are now talking about across the world,

1364
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,130
Dr Geert Vanden
Bossche, who was former

1365
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:43,100
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">[Global Alliance for
Vaccines and Immunization]</font>

1366
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:43,100
charge of the ebola vaccine program
for GAVI, the number one largest

1367
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:48,260
vaccine company, you know,
or nonprofit NGO in the world.

1368
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:54,860
When you see doctor Robert Malone,
who invented the mRNA vaccine technology

1369
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,710
when people like
that start speaking out

1370
01:23:58,010 --> 01:24:02,343
against the vaccine and warning that it
may not be doing what we think it's doing

1371
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:08,690
perhaps, pressuring the virus to become more deadly,
which could be very catastrophic to our species

1372
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:12,020
or doctor Michael Yeadon
who is an ex vice president

1373
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:16,345
at Pfizer who's come out against
this vaccine. He has spent his whole

1374
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:19,460
life in immunology and
allergies and vaccines.

1375
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:24,110
These people made their
legacies on vaccination.

1376
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:29,450
So when they come out and say this
vaccine is dangerous, it's not just that we

1377
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:34,340
[...] think it was rushed, we know the
problems behind the scenes with this product

1378
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:38,390
and we're telling you you need to stop
this mass vaccination program immediately.

1379
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:41,960
I listen, I mean, I think the
whole world should be listening

1380
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,760
and frankly I do believe that more
and more people are starting to listen.

1381
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,060
Unfortunately not just because
these scientists have spoken out

1382
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:53,720
but because we are seeing
so many people we know dying

1383
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:56,630
right after receiving the
vaccine or children we know

1384
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:59,270
having their heart swell
and getting myocarditis

1385
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,100
right after the vaccine. I mean...

1386
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:05,990
This is the problem when you rush a
product that is this experimental out.

1387
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,040
It doesn't matter how much
propaganda you have behind it

1388
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:14,180
you can't hide the damage that
it's doing and what we now know is

1389
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:21,380
this vaccine [...] has more death
reports then every single vaccine

1390
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:26,090
ever made in America [...]
combined over the last twenty years

1391
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:29,660
we have not gotten this many death
reports from all of them combined

1392
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,760
as we have in the
last eight months

1393
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:36,050
of these three Covid vaccines
here in the United States of America

1394
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,610
and then you couple that

1395
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,530
with the pressure by Joe Biden now and the
government of the United States is essentially saying

1396
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,120
I am going to forcibly vaccinate you whether
I have to do it through your employer

1397
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,753
whether I have to do it
through your ability to travel

1398
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:53,090
whether I have to do it through
your university and mark my words

1399
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:56,270
by the time this video
is out we might find out

1400
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:59,980
that you can't get into a grocery
store without a vaccine passport.

1401
01:26:00,004 --> 01:26:04,790
I mean this thing is moving so fast
and what's I think brilliant about it

1402
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,900
is instead of it having the
reaction in America that I'm

1403
01:26:09,079 --> 01:26:13,430
sure they hope for which as we all sort
of just bend over or kowtow and take it.

1404
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:19,040
It is actually waking up that
spirit inside of Americans that

1405
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:24,200
I think we are remembering our [...] history
and our DNA and our founding fathers that

1406
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:28,070
fought for freedom against
oppression and when we feel oppression

1407
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,790
it doesn't make us shut down, it
actually wakes us up and says

1408
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:35,810
maybe it's time to fight and that's
what we're seeing all across this country.

1409
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:42,740
I was really depressed or upset or somewhat
frustrated with America because on the Highwire

1410
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:47,210
we kept showing, you know,
million people in London

1411
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:51,980
marching, a million people in Germany and
France and just I'm watching all these other

1412
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:55,130
nations, Canada
really standing up and

1413
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,090
you know, out in the streets and I just
kept thinking where is America what is it

1414
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:01,010
going to take for
America to wake up?

1415
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,830
And then just as probably
about a month and a half ago now

1416
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:07,850
I couldn't sleep in the middle of the night
and I'm watching TV and the news comes on

1417
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:09,080
it's I think a CBS

1418
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:14,870
and they said we've just reached
42% of America is now fully vaccinated.

1419
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:17,150
And I was shocked

1420
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:21,140
I'd been hearing them telling
me like numbers like 75% or 80%

1421
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:24,980
and I know and then I reached out to the
sources and it was true in England, you know,

1422
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:30,380
they're nearing 75% vaccination, Germany
really high, you know, France, Spain

1423
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:33,731
we have one of the lowest
vaccination rates in the world,

1424
01:27:33,755 --> 01:27:36,470
especially in the modern
industrialized world

1425
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:41,150
and I just thought to myself I kinda
got a little glow and a sort of giggle

1426
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:45,200
because we may not be marching the
streets in the United States of America

1427
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:50,340
but quietly there has been a
resistance that's going on and now

1428
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:55,040
that is apparent to our government it's
apparent to the world, I am sure Joe Biden

1429
01:27:55,280 --> 01:28:02,090
is being pressured by this globalist's
push to make everybody be members of this

1430
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:04,490
constant vaxination program

1431
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,920
that guy who said Joe you
better get your act together

1432
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,450
you're dragging a boat anchored on what
we want to do here in moving the world

1433
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:14,570
forward with the great
reset and all of these things

1434
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:18,650
I don't think Joe's going to be able to
pull it off because the more pressure he now

1435
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:23,960
brings on that remaining half this
nation, as I said the more we're rising up.

1436
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:30,050
and it's feeding a movement and I think
in many ways, ironically or shockingly,

1437
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:32,780
this is what had
to happen for us

1438
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,770
to I think stand up and fight for freedom
the way that we should have probably done

1439
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:38,870
it ten years ago,
it's happening now.

1440
01:28:39,826 --> 01:28:43,470
- Yeah, and more to your
point. It was interesting when

1441
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,970
Biden was talking about the unvaccinated
in one of his speeches and he said

1442
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:51,710
you know, "Our patience is wearing
thin", as it like a threat, you know.

1443
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:55,970
We've been tolerant we've been patient with
you people, but yet now our patience is

1444
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:59,150
wearing thin, meaning we are
going to force you against your will.

1445
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:03,320
And [...] I think, you know, recently we're starting
to see some demonstrations erupted in

1446
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:06,160
the United States which is good I
think there's one in New York recently

1447
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:09,890
and [...] people really do
need to take to the streets.

1448
01:29:10,676 --> 01:29:13,184
I'm hoping they underestimated,
you know, the resid.

1449
01:29:13,209 --> 01:29:16,940
They thought fear as it could be weaponized
enough where people would just submit.

1450
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:20,390
And that's really not a
part of the DNA of Americans.

1451
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:22,850
Yeah, they're going to respond.

1452
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:27,470
I had [...], you probably have heard stories
too and these are of course anecdotal but

1453
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:31,580
I happened to run into a guy yesterday,
we were going for brunch, stayed in Bartell

1454
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:34,670
we started to talk and he
finds out I was with Zach Bush

1455
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:37,940
and my wife and [...] he
finds out that we're doctors and

1456
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:40,340
and he really gently just says

1457
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:43,160
"Mind if I ask you a
question about the vaccine?"

1458
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:48,050
and, I said, sure, I think you're
talking to the right people right now,

1459
01:29:49,048 --> 01:29:50,300
or maybe you are.

1460
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,476
As far as I dunno what he was looking
for he said "You know, I'm unvaccinated"

1461
01:29:54,501 --> 01:29:57,660
and I said well we aren't
either, he's like "oh okay"

1462
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:02,060
He begins to tell us about a
woman they just met that was a nurse.

1463
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:07,040
That he would start [...] set up, yo, mutual
friends, what have you, they're going to date.

1464
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:11,960
And before the first date, she was [...]
struggling with this issue because she [...]

1465
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,870
had to get the vaccine she
had two kids, single mum.

1466
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:19,400
Had [...] to get the vaccine before she can go
back to work. Her employer was mandating it.

1467
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:22,970
She really didn't want it. She's weighing
it out. I'm responsible for these kids.

1468
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:26,300
And... what happened...
she has the first vaccine

1469
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:28,940
and really really
bad response I mean

1470
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:31,670
you know, hospitalized
etc from the first dose.

1471
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:37,130
And I look at him and I said, yo, can I
interview her for our series that, yo, I want

1472
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:38,840
people to be able
to tell their story

1473
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:43,550
and he said, no you can't, yo, shocked
me, you can't, [...] and I said [...]

1474
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:46,370
He said, she went back and
got the second dose and died.

1475
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:50,390
- Wow.
- Stunned silence cause I'm looking at somebody who was reluctant,

1476
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:52,310
but a single mom with two kids,

1477
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:57,290
her economic liberty being threatened, you
know, it's not just medical here, it's not just

1478
01:30:57,290 --> 01:30:59,600
social "Can I go to a
grocery store?", it's economic.

1479
01:31:00,410 --> 01:31:03,680
And she's dead and and whether it gets
countered or not is of course another thing

1480
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:07,190
and I'm sure you've had some conversations
around this because you cited the fact

1481
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:10,640
that we've got these extraordinary
number of reported deaths

1482
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:13,790
but has anybody given
you any indication

1483
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:19,460
as to, you know, how under reported,
you know, the adverse events might be?

1484
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:22,250
- You know, I just did
an interview on my show

1485
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:26,510
a little bit ago with a whistleblower
from inside of a hospital.

1486
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:30,620
That came forward and described
exactly what she came upon.

1487
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:35,060
Believed in the vaccine,
believed, you know, in the pandemic

1488
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:39,740
but started seeing really weird
issues happen in a hospital.

1489
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:44,330
This incredible rise in
cancers, weird cancers.

1490
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:50,540
People, that were in remission, suddenly just like
crazy piling in and [...] their cancer is back

1491
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:53,510
and it's moving so aggressively
that before they could even get a

1492
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:55,310
biopsy the person is dead

1493
01:31:55,730 --> 01:32:01,010
and then thrombocytopenia and blood
clots at numbers she had never seen before

1494
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:05,210
and she just thought
something's wrong and I'm

1495
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:08,090
gonna have to say that the only
thing I know we've changed is

1496
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:11,900
we're giving this vaccine like crazy so
then when she started investigating it

1497
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,971
she found out there
was this thing called

1498
01:32:13,996 --> 01:32:16,580
VAERS, Vaccine Adverse
Events Reporting System

1499
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:20,300
Let me say that again, twenty
year veteran in a hospital

1500
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,750
who is on like, you know,
in sort of committees that

1501
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,110
decides new protocols
and things to very high up

1502
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:32,299
discovered this year something called VAERS
(the vaccine adverse events reporting system).

1503
01:32:32,324 --> 01:32:34,820
This is the reporting
system for the nation

1504
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,930
that every doctor is supposed to
know about if someone is injured.

1505
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:42,920
And so, that right
there tells you [...]

1506
01:32:42,945 --> 01:32:45,350
There was a study and
we've talked about this before

1507
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:47,180
done by Harvard Medical School.

1508
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:52,160
A CDC funded them, paid them about like a
million dollars to investigate our capture

1509
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:57,770
system VAERS to see how efficient
it is at capturing vaccine injury.

1510
01:32:57,950 --> 01:33:02,900
After a thorough review and investigation,
I think it went on for about a year,

1511
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:06,950
and then using their own HMO
system and automating it to see

1512
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:11,060
what types of reporting was going on
inside of their own insurance system

1513
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:16,460
they came to the conclusion that
VAERS is capturing less than 1%

1514
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:19,940
of vaccine injuries.
Now I've been on other

1515
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:22,880
interviews with you, where we
talked about that before Covid

1516
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
we talked about

1517
01:33:24,043 --> 01:33:29,400
there was 400 diseases, around 400
to 500 deaths every year from vaccines

1518
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:32,570
and I've said if that
is only one percent...

1519
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:35,150
That only ends up
being one percent

1520
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:38,390
then what is that
40000 deaths, you know,

1521
01:33:38,810 --> 01:33:44,720
by the time [...] we do the actual numbers every
year in the United States of America from all the

1522
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:45,720
vaccines we're giving?

1523
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:49,400
Well, now we have a vaccine
that in the last eight months

1524
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:55,040
is listed as having on VAERS
14 000 reported deaths.

1525
01:33:55,490 --> 01:34:01,430
Ok? If that's one percent, then we're in
real trouble now, right? Now we're talking

1526
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:06,140
what, a 140 000
deaths from this vaccine

1527
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:10,310
just right now as we speak? Or let's
just go ahead and [...] I'm gonna make this

1528
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:11,900
argument. This is the
argument right now as

1529
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:16,670
well all the doctors know under the emergency
use authorization they supposed to report

1530
01:34:16,670 --> 01:34:20,390
these things so we believe it's
above that one percent where it's been.

1531
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:23,000
And that was the
interview I had

1532
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:25,384
with Deborah was her name
on my show and you can

1533
01:34:25,409 --> 01:34:27,710
go watch the show
super interesting interview

1534
01:34:25,409 --> 01:34:27,710
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">[The Highwire with Del Bigtree
- THE VAERS SCANDAL]</font>

1535
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:31,040
you know, with the
emergency use authorization

1536
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:33,710
where she said no we were never
told that's what was so shocking

1537
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:36,950
is how is it you're releasing
this thing as an emergency

1538
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:40,730
every hospital now, every person
in America has now become a part

1539
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:44,780
of the largest test group, the
largest experiment of all times

1540
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,670
yet you didn't warn us

1541
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:50,900
that our job was going to be to report
any injuries that we're seeing and then

1542
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:53,300
she tells her hospital
[...] what starts out with

1543
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:57,950
she's putting up all of her cases she
sees VAERS and she says that VAERS says

1544
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:02,100
you are obligated to, you're
mandated essentially as a [...] doctor

1545
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:04,460
to report these
injuries and it says

1546
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:08,736
it's not up to you to determine whether
or not the vaccine caused these issues

1547
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:09,710
it's really just

1548
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:13,760
if there's a strange issue that happens
within the first two months after vaccination

1549
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:17,510
just report it. We'll take
it from there and [...] see

1550
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:20,030
how accurate it is
or if we start seeing

1551
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:23,720
anomalies or things that are
consistent we can figure things out

1552
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,660
so she went to the rest of
her staff and started saying

1553
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,262
to the ER doctors
and to the pediatricians

1554
01:35:29,286 --> 01:35:33,764
"Are you reporting these weird instances
that are happening with your patients?",

1555
01:35:33,788 --> 01:35:36,499
they [are], like, "No I didn't...
Where do you do that?",

1556
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:37,610
she's, like, well, it's VAERS

1557
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:42,265
and then they look at it, most of them, like, "Oh man,
that's too time consuming, I don't have time for that."

1558
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:46,580
So she took it upon herself to say that,
fine, I think this is really important

1559
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,300
you know, [...] we're telling the
world this vaccine is safe and effective

1560
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:54,200
how do we know it's safe if hospitals like
ours aren't reporting all of the injuries

1561
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,466
that are coming through the door?

1562
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:59,480
So she started saying just give me
your reports I will take my weekends,

1563
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:01,850
my week off and
spend the whole time

1564
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,070
reporting all of these
things to VAERS.

1565
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:05,750
Well then her hospital

1566
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:09,865
finds out about it because she's in touch,
she actually said to them so it's not a big...

1567
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:13,010
One of the things she did, she sent
an email to everybody and saying

1568
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:17,120
"Do you know that thrombocytopenia
and this blood clot issue

1569
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:19,880
that is happening all the
time coming through our doors

1570
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:24,230
that we should not be treating it
with blood thinners like heparin

1571
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:27,770
because it's actually been caused
by the vaccine and if you give

1572
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:29,810
the normal treatment
to a blood clot

1573
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:36,170
the person will die they could bleed out?" So she just
gave this [...] advice that she had just read about

1574
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:38,390
through information from the CDC

1575
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:40,703
and that got her in trouble the
hospital said, what are you doing?

1576
01:36:40,727 --> 01:36:43,640
What are you doing talking
out against this vaccine?

1577
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,720
And they basically shut her down and said
you were not to do any of these reports

1578
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,610
with any patients
except your own

1579
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:52,310
and stop talking to
everybody else and so...

1580
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:56,780
There's where you're at, that's just
one hospital, but we can only assume

1581
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:03,320
when the hospital is promoting the vaccine,
all of it's signage says get your vaccine today

1582
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,740
that if they're that excited about
a product, that hasn't been tested

1583
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:11,120
it's doubtful they are going to go out
of their way to point out the problems.

1584
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:14,150
And submit those
problems to VAERS and so...

1585
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,190
I would have to guess that we

1586
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:22,280
we may even be worse than we were before.
There is such a desire for this vaccine to work

1587
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,340
and to get us out...
get us back normal

1588
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:29,000
that there may be a lot of doctors and
nurses that are literally looking the other

1589
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
way on purpose.

1590
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:33,440
- My biggest concern, you know,
to your point about this being a

1591
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:39,740
huge massive experiment is that, you know, there's
no controls or parameters around the experiment

1592
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:41,180
for attribution.

1593
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:45,055
You know, cause as you're citing all
these weird conditions are coming in,

1594
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:50,210
but nobody is saying it in terms of "Oh, that might
be related to vaccine or might be vaccine injury."

1595
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:55,550
and [...] I think the the real chilling
part in speaking with people like

1596
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:59,655
doctor Malone or Peter McCullough
also, they both had said the same thing.

1597
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:02,600
They said that this isn't just a
vaccine, it's also gene therapy

1598
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:07,019
and they said studies to really do
[...] safety studies on gene therapy

1599
01:38:07,044 --> 01:38:10,440
it requires ten years
to do it properly.

1600
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:12,290
So we don't even know

1601
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:15,230
what we've got in any
way shape or form and

1602
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:17,300
we don't have attribution
even happening.

1603
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:21,170
Currently saying that, you know, there could
be cause and effect here let's run it down.

1604
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,580
Not happening.

1605
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:27,829
So [...] and the
question is that willful?

1606
01:38:27,853 --> 01:38:32,510
Meaning, hey, they don't want
attribution, they don't want to even

1607
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:37,100
have the hint of it 'cause it might create
vaccine hesitancy, you know, to use their terms.

1608
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:45,720
So we're [...] really in this very, kind of,
spooky place and I'm wondering, you know,

1609
01:38:45,745 --> 01:38:48,350
what your sentiments are
around how much of this is

1610
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:54,050
[...] how can I put it... misguided, you
know, good intentions that are misguided.

1611
01:38:54,590 --> 01:39:00,680
And how much of it is more, you know, willful
great profit motive or other such things that

1612
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:06,890
are causing, you know, this lack of
respect for trying to get to the truth?

1613
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:10,640
- Well let me answer that with some obvious
facts and the types of things that set off

1614
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:14,060
red flags in someone like
myself, a medical journalist.

1615
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:15,390
Number one.

1616
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:19,160
It is what people need to
understand is a few things.

1617
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:26,760
This mRNA vaccine technology had never been
injected into an animal in an animal trial.

1618
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:32,370
Before we injected it into human beings in those
trials that we sought to just start last year.

1619
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:36,410
That those trial groups in the
third phase [...] that trial was

1620
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:38,330
supposed to last
at least two years

1621
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:41,390
but about two
weeks after all those

1622
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:47,330
45 000 in the Pfizer... I think, [it was] Pfizer
[who] had 45 000, Moderna had 35 000 people

1623
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:50,570
half of them getting a placebo and
the other half getting the vaccination

1624
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:53,360
I want say I'm proud of that
placebo group really quickly

1625
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:56,240
there wasn't going to be
a saline placebo group

1626
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:59,420
except that my nonprofit
informed consent action network

1627
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:04,920
essentially threaten the FDA with a lawsuit that we
would come out against the safety of this vaccine

1628
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:07,970
if they did not have an
appropriate control, that is,

1629
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:11,570
a group that was getting a saline
injections so we could establish

1630
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:13,700
a safety baseline.

1631
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:19,044
The FDA actually got our notice
and then within two days shut down all

1632
01:40:19,069 --> 01:40:21,200
phase three trials and
about five days later

1633
01:40:21,410 --> 01:40:25,340
changed the protocol and added that
saline placebo so were really happy.

1634
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:29,840
That at least we were making sure that
we were going to get a proper safety trial

1635
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:32,030
but then what they
do, they bailed out early.

1636
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:35,870
Instead of tracking and following
those people for two years

1637
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:38,330
in a closed environment
where we would see

1638
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:42,260
how many, you know, had
immediate issues, like, anaphylaxis or

1639
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:46,400
this thrombocytopenia and blood clots
and heart attacks and strokes and [...]

1640
01:40:46,524 --> 01:40:48,770
bell's palsy, all these
things we've heard about

1641
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:51,560
compared to those that
only got the saline injection.

1642
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:54,950
As I said about two weeks
after that second shot

1643
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:58,100
they submitted for the
emergency use authorization

1644
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:01,520
that essentially let them
bail out of these trials

1645
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:05,300
and then just give this to
people all across the world.

1646
01:41:06,170 --> 01:41:09,620
And so what that did
was it then as I just said

1647
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:16,610
earlier it turned all of us into a
clinical trial, a worldwide clinical trial.

1648
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:19,700
Well, if you're going to do that and
you're going to have a clinical trial

1649
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:24,380
you need to be tracking and following
the injuries that are happening and so...

1650
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,480
If this was accidental

1651
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:31,640
and [...] you would have done all
the precautions that are necessary.

1652
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:39,745
Let me just say the simplest thing: we now have
Joe Biden threatening, I think, it's 14 000$

1653
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:44,210
judgments against any employer that
doesn't bring a forced vaccination program.

1654
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:50,122
Over the [...] hundred employee level and
corporations that are larger than a hundred employees

1655
01:41:50,332 --> 01:41:53,655
if they don't bring a mandatory
vaccine program the government's

1656
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:56,218
going to fine them 14 000$.

1657
01:41:56,242 --> 01:42:01,192
Meanwhile there are doctors and nurses as
I just interviewed all across this nation

1658
01:42:01,372 --> 01:42:04,972
that don't know that their
job right now is to be capturing

1659
01:42:05,212 --> 01:42:09,712
and logging all of the injuries that are
happening from this vaccine so that we know

1660
01:42:09,737 --> 01:42:12,982
[...] is it safer than
the virus itself?

1661
01:42:13,132 --> 01:42:17,002
Is it causing more injury than the virus
itself? There's only one way to know that.

1662
01:42:17,182 --> 01:42:19,762
You need to be capturing it.
And what did they do?

1663
01:42:19,942 --> 01:42:22,522
They didn't do anything.
They didn't make Merck...

1664
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,352
In the EUA [Emergency Use Authorization]
they said look we're going to

1665
01:42:24,532 --> 01:42:27,382
let you make tens of
billions of dollars this year

1666
01:42:27,562 --> 01:42:31,132
but you better build a
robust capture system

1667
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:34,312
that takes in all the injuries that are
out there. They didn't do that. They didn't

1668
01:42:34,312 --> 01:42:35,392
make that a point

1669
01:42:35,632 --> 01:42:39,502
of how you get your EUA and how
you get to all be billionaires and in fact

1670
01:42:39,682 --> 01:42:43,612
this product has turned people into
billionaires that are presidents and CEOs of

1671
01:42:43,612 --> 01:42:44,182
those companies

1672
01:42:44,452 --> 01:42:48,352
but they could have even been simpler than
that, if you don't want to trust Pfizer

1673
01:42:48,532 --> 01:42:50,002
or you don't want
to trust Moderna

1674
01:42:50,182 --> 01:42:53,902
why didn't you just say to all
the doctors and nurses in America

1675
01:42:54,112 --> 01:42:58,552
[...] it's so critical to
understand the safety of this product

1676
01:42:58,732 --> 01:43:02,002
that is only weeks into being
injected into human beings

1677
01:43:02,212 --> 01:43:07,222
that we're going to mandate and we're going
to send people out for classes in every

1678
01:43:07,222 --> 01:43:09,862
hospital "How you
do a report to VAERS"

1679
01:43:10,072 --> 01:43:13,612
And if you don't do it you are
the ones that [...] will be fined

1680
01:43:13,762 --> 01:43:18,322
We will find your hospital if [...] we
find out you're not reporting the injuries

1681
01:43:18,532 --> 01:43:23,332
that is what a CDC and an FDA
absolutely should have done

1682
01:43:23,572 --> 01:43:26,482
if they cared about the
safety of this product

1683
01:43:26,722 --> 01:43:29,392
if they really wanted
to know the answers to

1684
01:43:29,602 --> 01:43:33,412
you know, "How effective is it?"
That's what they should have done.

1685
01:43:33,712 --> 01:43:38,272
And instead they didn't tell anybody anything.
They didn't tell hospitals you're the

1686
01:43:38,272 --> 01:43:39,382
ones we're counting on.

1687
01:43:39,652 --> 01:43:42,382
And then when none of those
hospitals report they tell us

1688
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:46,162
look we're not getting any reports
the vaccine appears to be very safe.

1689
01:43:46,822 --> 01:43:49,942
That right there tells me that
at least at the highest levels

1690
01:43:50,122 --> 01:43:54,772
of decision making the heads of
the FDA, Tony Fauci, NIH, CDC

1691
01:43:55,042 --> 01:43:56,932
these people know
what they're doing.

1692
01:43:57,742 --> 01:44:02,542
And it is willful ignorance
that I think really could cost us

1693
01:44:02,842 --> 01:44:05,302
hundreds of millions
if not billions of lives.

1694
01:44:06,562 --> 01:44:09,832
That completes part one of my
two part interview with Del Bigtree

1695
01:44:10,102 --> 01:44:14,422
and I suspect that you are really interested
in seeing part two after seeing part one

1696
01:44:14,669 --> 01:44:18,542
It's gonna be coming up later on so
make sure you stay tuned to see it.

1697
01:44:28,192 --> 01:44:34,972
One of the most critical voices in the
chaos of Covid is doctor Robert Malone. Why?

1698
01:44:35,332 --> 01:44:38,992
Because he is the pioneering
inventor of the mRNA vaccine.

1699
01:44:39,412 --> 01:44:44,272
Now when dr Malone start to raise his
voice and start to speak to concerns he had

1700
01:44:44,272 --> 01:44:46,852
relative to the vaccine
and the vaccine program

1701
01:44:47,182 --> 01:44:49,822
he was viciously attacked
and [they] tried to cancel him

1702
01:44:50,032 --> 01:44:52,702
they tried to actually
rewrite history

1703
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:58,282
trying to deny that he played the role he
did in the development of mRNA vaccines.

1704
01:44:58,792 --> 01:45:00,772
So in this three part interview

1705
01:45:01,162 --> 01:45:06,472
part one starts out focused on
the storyline and the background

1706
01:45:06,742 --> 01:45:10,432
What did he do? Where did
he do it? When did he do it?

1707
01:45:10,642 --> 01:45:14,812
Why am I spending time there?
Because I want to establish the fact

1708
01:45:15,472 --> 01:45:20,752
that he played a seminal role in
the development of mRNA vaccines.

1709
01:45:21,142 --> 01:45:25,762
And once we established that, then we
go on to other aspects of the conversations

1710
01:45:25,972 --> 01:45:27,292
that you must hear.

1711
01:45:27,712 --> 01:45:32,002
This conversation is not an option for anyone.
You need to hear what doctor Robert Malone

1712
01:45:32,302 --> 01:45:36,982
has to say about Covid and the
Covid vaccines so this is part one.

1713
01:45:37,492 --> 01:45:38,492
Let's get started.

1714
01:45:39,289 --> 01:45:43,732
Dr. Malone, thanks for taking the time to
sit with us and tell us what you know about

1715
01:45:43,942 --> 01:45:45,262
this particular subject.

1716
01:45:45,682 --> 01:45:50,092
[...] I'd like to start out really with
your background, your academic background.

1717
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:55,132
Can you, kind of, give us the evolution
of it starting with medical school maybe?

1718
01:45:55,554 --> 01:45:57,592
- Yeah, it really goes a
little deeper than that.

1719
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:03,292
[...] I had been a computer science student
for the first two years of my undergraduate and

1720
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:05,332
decided I didn't want
to continue staring at a

1721
01:46:05,662 --> 01:46:07,942
computer screen in a
room with no windows

1722
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:11,152
and I wanted to go into
molecular biology and

1723
01:46:11,392 --> 01:46:16,852
[...] This was a hot new topic
at the time. This is early 1980s.

1724
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:21,982
I went to UC Davis [University of California, Davis]
for my last two years of undergraduate training.

1725
01:46:22,672 --> 01:46:27,652
And the honest truth is my mother
was deathly afraid of breast cancer.

1726
01:46:28,162 --> 01:46:31,582
And I wanted to [...] spend
some time in the laboratory

1727
01:46:32,092 --> 01:46:36,772
during the undergraduate years to learn
whether this was really a good career idea.

1728
01:46:37,827 --> 01:46:43,372
I had an opportunity to join a laboratory
in the department of pathology at UC Davis.

1729
01:46:44,122 --> 01:46:48,502
And went for my interview
with the pathologists there [...]

1730
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:51,532
who eventually became
my department chair later on

1731
01:46:51,557 --> 01:46:52,832
[Bob Curtive?]

1732
01:46:52,942 --> 01:46:58,552
And I had done well for my first two years
of school and so I tried to be modest but

1733
01:46:58,687 --> 01:47:03,112
[...] forthright and say that [...] I really
wanted to work for him and [...] do breast

1734
01:47:03,112 --> 01:47:04,112
cancer research.

1735
01:47:04,582 --> 01:47:06,592
And he [...] looked
me straight in the eye

1736
01:47:06,892 --> 01:47:08,492
it's something I'll
never forget he says,

1737
01:47:08,962 --> 01:47:14,612
I have no time for false modesty and that was [...]
kind of a you're not in Kansas anymore moment.

1738
01:47:15,562 --> 01:47:17,222
[...] but he took me in.

1739
01:47:17,872 --> 01:47:21,472
And that turned out to be
kind of a seminal event because

1740
01:47:21,682 --> 01:47:23,302
that he had just come from

1741
01:47:23,327 --> 01:47:30,812
[...] a fellowship of sabbatical with Bishop and Varmus [J. Michael
Bishop and Harold E. Varmus] who got the nobel prize for oncogenes.

1742
01:47:30,892 --> 01:47:36,952
And he'd set up the operation together
with a guy, they'd just recruited from

1743
01:47:37,282 --> 01:47:39,652
USC cancer center,
named Murray [B] Gardner.

1744
01:47:40,192 --> 01:47:42,262
to become a department chair.

1745
01:47:43,342 --> 01:47:48,832
And Murray had a long history
in being at the absolute forefront of

1746
01:47:48,952 --> 01:47:56,032
molecular genetics and cancer and cancer
vaccines and they landed there, Murray did.

1747
01:47:56,302 --> 01:47:59,602
Bob had already been there
working on mouse biology, mostly.

1748
01:48:00,082 --> 01:48:02,962
and as a pathologist is
his experimental area.

1749
01:48:03,832 --> 01:48:07,142
And it's happened.

1750
01:48:08,452 --> 01:48:09,952
And this is [UC] Davis.

1751
01:48:10,972 --> 01:48:13,912
So I got to meet
people like Don Francis.

1752
01:48:14,752 --> 01:48:19,552
And I got to see the very earliest
days of the whole AIDS story develop.

1753
01:48:20,212 --> 01:48:27,802
And Murray and Preston [A.?]
Marx and others in the lab group

1754
01:48:28,162 --> 01:48:32,392
had this observation that there was a
immunodeficiency syndrome in the macaques

1755
01:48:32,392 --> 01:48:33,392
at the primate centre.

1756
01:48:33,952 --> 01:48:37,372
And they tracked it down and found
that it was associated with the retrovirus.

1757
01:48:37,762 --> 01:48:40,372
That was the first disclosure
[it] was published in Lancet

1758
01:48:40,792 --> 01:48:46,792
and it for me as an undergraduate, you
know, total labrat every free moment I was

1759
01:48:46,792 --> 01:48:48,562
spending in the
laboratory working on

1760
01:48:48,982 --> 01:48:53,932
the molecular biology of [...] mouse mammary
tumor virus and working with RNA and DNA.

1761
01:48:54,412 --> 01:48:55,612
And this thing happened.

1762
01:48:56,362 --> 01:49:00,922
This new disease, this new outbreak
in the lab was right at the forefront.

1763
01:49:01,437 --> 01:49:08,242
And Murray travelled [...] if you've ever
seen "And the Band Played On" [TV Movie 1993].

1764
01:49:09,112 --> 01:49:16,982
Murray went with Bob Gallo for this infamous
trip to visit Luc Montagnier and Françoise Barré.

1765
01:49:17,032 --> 01:49:22,582
and I never get [it] out
of my mind: Murray,

1766
01:49:22,762 --> 01:49:26,062
you know, this older pathologist
almost dancing down the hall

1767
01:49:26,482 --> 01:49:28,239
after he came back
from the trip saying I've

1768
01:49:28,264 --> 01:49:31,318
got the virus that causes
AIDS in my pocket.

1769
01:49:31,342 --> 01:49:34,642
Then they proceeded to
try to develop vaccines etc

1770
01:49:34,972 --> 01:49:38,932
and that was kind of how I cut my teeth, there
was a lot of heavy politics that went on.

1771
01:49:38,957 --> 01:49:41,542
You know, those early
days of aids are pretty intense.

1772
01:49:41,902 --> 01:49:43,642
A lot of incredible competition.

1773
01:49:44,422 --> 01:49:47,692
And from that I really
wanted to work on retroviruses.

1774
01:49:47,872 --> 01:49:48,872
- What is a retrovirus?

1775
01:49:49,402 --> 01:49:55,462
- So retrovirus... that the term retro has
nothing to do with the 1950s or mid century.

1776
01:49:55,912 --> 01:50:02,092
It has to do with the fact that [...]
the central dogma of biology is that

1777
01:50:02,422 --> 01:50:08,012
DNA makes RNA, RNA makes protein, right? So that it's
still linear process, it only goes in one direction.

1778
01:50:08,722 --> 01:50:13,702
And the odd thing about these [...]
viruses that were associated with cancer,

1779
01:50:13,942 --> 01:50:15,712
so this is why it was
particularly relevant,

1780
01:50:16,462 --> 01:50:22,592
is that many of these had the characteristic
that they existed as RNA as their genome.

1781
01:50:22,912 --> 01:50:28,432
When they are a virus form outside of the
cell and yet had a DNA form inside the cell,

1782
01:50:28,582 --> 01:50:29,582
so that's backwards.

1783
01:50:29,842 --> 01:50:36,802
It's supposed to go DNA to RNA to protein,
not RNA back to DNA, so that's retro.

1784
01:50:38,032 --> 01:50:41,182
And it has a specific enzyme
called reverse transcriptase.

1785
01:50:41,662 --> 01:50:45,022
That is responsible for that that
was characterized by David Baltimore

1786
01:50:45,442 --> 01:50:50,392
and by the guy that eventually became
my PhD mentor of sorts in November.

1787
01:50:51,412 --> 01:50:55,132
So that's what a retroviruses
is. It's a virus that goes...

1788
01:50:55,762 --> 01:50:58,012
has a life cycle that's
kind of backwards.

1789
01:50:58,402 --> 01:51:02,992
It exists as an RNA molecule for
its genome when it's outside the cell

1790
01:51:03,352 --> 01:51:06,982
and then that gets converted into DNA
and integrated into the chromosome.

1791
01:51:07,642 --> 01:51:09,562
So that's [...] how I
kind of got that start

1792
01:51:09,892 --> 01:51:16,582
and I wanted to continue to
focus on retroviruses. I had...

1793
01:51:17,392 --> 01:51:22,012
To [...] imagine back in...
just to set the stage... the 80s

1794
01:51:22,222 --> 01:51:25,312
were... it was insanely competitive
to get into medical school.

1795
01:51:26,152 --> 01:51:29,932
And to have the hubris to think
that you would be able to do so,

1796
01:51:30,232 --> 01:51:33,382
was a little beyond the
pale but I wanted to try.

1797
01:51:35,032 --> 01:51:39,772
And, so being in this laboratory environment
with these guys and the work that I did and

1798
01:51:39,772 --> 01:51:43,822
the hard work that I showed
and my kind of skill set for it

1799
01:51:44,452 --> 01:51:49,642
[...] got me an MD PhD scholarship
which was way beyond my expectations but

1800
01:51:50,092 --> 01:51:54,592
[...] at the time it, you know,
it was kind of a fallback.

1801
01:51:55,008 --> 01:51:58,728
What can I do if I don't get that, I'm
probably not going to get it and whatever.

1802
01:51:59,628 --> 01:52:02,928
But once I got accepted I was like,
okay, what are you going to do with this?

1803
01:52:03,978 --> 01:52:06,558
You know, I don't want
to be just another doc.

1804
01:52:06,918 --> 01:52:10,248
I wanted to carry on with the science,
I was totally wrapped up in the science

1805
01:52:10,668 --> 01:52:12,348
and working with retroviruses.

1806
01:52:12,498 --> 01:52:20,268
So one of the hot topics for a a young person
in this emerging field was gene therapy.

1807
01:52:21,198 --> 01:52:27,888
And, so the gene therapy using
retroviruses was the leading method.

1808
01:52:28,518 --> 01:52:31,068
Gene therapy had actually
been around conceptually

1809
01:52:31,248 --> 01:52:34,578
since the late seventies Ted Friedman
[Theodore Friedmann] had come up with the idea.

1810
01:52:35,208 --> 01:52:38,688
By but the embodiment that was
working was using retroviruses

1811
01:52:38,898 --> 01:52:43,818
and you would place your gene
of interest into the retrovirus and

1812
01:52:44,208 --> 01:52:48,408
engineered in certain ways that it would be
packaged in and you could infect other cells.

1813
01:52:48,588 --> 01:52:51,288
When I made the decision that
I wanted to chase this dragon

1814
01:52:52,702 --> 01:52:59,928
[...] I had imagined that there would
be gene therapists in every hospital

1815
01:53:00,114 --> 01:53:02,334
[...] it got to become
mainstream by the time.

1816
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:03,778
You know, like the present day.

1817
01:53:04,008 --> 01:53:08,118
[...] There would be gene therapists everywhere
when we would be burning through curing

1818
01:53:08,118 --> 01:53:09,888
pediatric disease
and all would be good.

1819
01:53:10,398 --> 01:53:14,208
[...] And so this is what
I really wanted to do

1820
01:53:14,628 --> 01:53:17,238
and I made it through
the first two years of school

1821
01:53:17,478 --> 01:53:21,138
and Jill, my wife, and I are

1822
01:53:21,288 --> 01:53:23,808
grew up in the Santa
Barbara area central coast.

1823
01:53:24,438 --> 01:53:28,848
And I had received a scholarship
from Northwestern university in Chicago.

1824
01:53:29,418 --> 01:53:32,138
And I went for my interview and
that was like a little weather break.

1825
01:53:32,934 --> 01:53:35,088
And so I came back
and I said Jill, I know this

1826
01:53:35,298 --> 01:53:37,458
stuff about Chicago,
Chicago's just fine.

1827
01:53:37,968 --> 01:53:39,468
And she will never forgive me.

1828
01:53:40,998 --> 01:53:46,848
And will never approve any relocation again.
And, you know, she has [...] executive

1829
01:53:47,489 --> 01:53:48,898
authority over that.

1830
01:53:49,008 --> 01:53:54,528
[...] And so after two years in
Chicago and a young son being born

1831
01:53:54,738 --> 01:53:56,058
she was pretty fed up.

1832
01:53:56,748 --> 01:54:01,068
And my experience was the molecular
biology that I was experiencing at

1833
01:54:01,068 --> 01:54:03,438
Northwestern and
that I had access to...

1834
01:54:03,918 --> 01:54:05,868
There were some great
people, I did some work

1835
01:54:06,258 --> 01:54:09,978
on RNA even there, but in also
with Bob Lamb [Robert A. Lamb].

1836
01:54:10,398 --> 01:54:11,568
with influenza.

1837
01:54:12,078 --> 01:54:15,258
But it just wasn't what I had
experienced on the west coast.

1838
01:54:16,188 --> 01:54:17,188
She wasn't happy.

1839
01:54:17,658 --> 01:54:19,608
So I applied for
graduate school in

1840
01:54:19,818 --> 01:54:22,188
in lieu of doing my
PhD at Northwestern.

1841
01:54:22,542 --> 01:54:27,498
And I'm having been now through two years of medical school
my GREs [Graduate Record Examinations] were just off scale

1842
01:54:27,918 --> 01:54:29,808
And so I kind of had
the pick of the litter

1843
01:54:30,138 --> 01:54:36,498
and UC San Diego had these two leading guys
Ted Friedman who'd originally imagined it

1844
01:54:36,888 --> 01:54:38,778
and Inder Verma
the Salk Institute.

1845
01:54:40,098 --> 01:54:42,558
And both we're working
on retroviral vectors

1846
01:54:42,978 --> 01:54:45,918
and so that's what led
me into that whole world.

1847
01:54:46,218 --> 01:54:50,508
And that was the origin of the
passion, it was about viruses

1848
01:54:50,958 --> 01:54:54,378
and particularly about retroviruses
and particularly about gene therapy.

1849
01:54:54,948 --> 01:54:59,568
- So it's interesting that
this was the passion as far as

1850
01:55:00,078 --> 01:55:03,708
seeing a potential future for
what this could mean to humanity

1851
01:55:04,188 --> 01:55:07,988
[...] and you ended up at the
Salk Institute for a period of time.

1852
01:55:08,178 --> 01:55:10,780
- Yeah.
- So did you finish your [...]

1853
01:55:11,088 --> 01:55:14,838
the postgrad work at [...] the
university and then went to Salk?

1854
01:55:15,078 --> 01:55:20,898
- So [...] the way that worked [...] is
that... [...] so you see San Diego at the time

1855
01:55:21,768 --> 01:55:27,318
Torrey Pines road in that hole La
Jolla complex was just taking off.

1856
01:55:27,888 --> 01:55:33,858
And [...] one of the founding companies in
the technology of monoclonal antibodies had

1857
01:55:33,858 --> 01:55:35,028
recently been sold

1858
01:55:35,478 --> 01:55:39,648
for a few hundred million dollars which at
the time just seemed everybody thought it

1859
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:42,678
was an enormous amount of
money for a biotech company.

1860
01:55:43,338 --> 01:55:44,448
How naive they were.

1861
01:55:44,778 --> 01:55:47,538
A friend of mine just sold
his company for 9.6 billion.

1862
01:55:48,198 --> 01:55:49,998
And all he does is
make RNA and DNA.

1863
01:55:50,688 --> 01:55:59,376
But that was that was then and [...] So
La Jolla was flooded with people that...

1864
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:02,058
There was a climate,
it was like a gold rush.

1865
01:56:03,288 --> 01:56:08,478
[...] A young faculty thought
they were going to get rich

1866
01:56:08,688 --> 01:56:11,088
you know, it was it
was truly a gold rush.

1867
01:56:11,628 --> 01:56:16,578
And I kind of landed in the middle of this
not really realizing how much it was going

1868
01:56:16,578 --> 01:56:21,948
to affect the whole culture of [...]
the environment including the Salk.

1869
01:56:22,218 --> 01:56:27,258
so I went there, and the structure was
that you get into the graduate school and

1870
01:56:28,188 --> 01:56:33,168
you have a lot of fairly intensive
coursework from leading thinkers.

1871
01:56:34,488 --> 01:56:38,268
You know it's not just the
Salk but Scripps Institute and

1872
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:43,338
I don't think La Jolla allergy/immunology was
there yet but there is some high powered folk.

1873
01:56:43,698 --> 01:56:47,628
At the Salk there was half a dozen nobel
laureates when I was there in and plus

1874
01:56:47,628 --> 01:56:48,828
Jonas was there still.

1875
01:56:49,248 --> 01:56:55,288
Including Francis Crick, so [...] it was
a, you know, pretty intense environment.

1876
01:56:55,338 --> 01:57:01,008
There is something akin to it.
At MIT with David Baltimore but

1877
01:57:01,548 --> 01:57:04,698
That La Jolla situation
was pretty intense so

1878
01:57:04,998 --> 01:57:10,348
I parachuted into this, took the coursework and
we had to do rotations as graduate students.

1879
01:57:10,488 --> 01:57:16,908
And, so I rotated through a laboratory that
if... this [is] kind of amazing in retrospect.

1880
01:57:17,298 --> 01:57:22,008
One of the guys that really wanted
to take me on was one of the top

1881
01:57:22,728 --> 01:57:25,008
people in viral
evolution at the time.

1882
01:57:25,368 --> 01:57:28,938
He was disappointed I didn't go to
work for him, one was Debbie Spector

1883
01:57:29,148 --> 01:57:32,628
who had just come from the
same Bishop and Varmus group.

1884
01:57:33,228 --> 01:57:36,468
And she was passionate, her and
her husband, were passionate about

1885
01:57:36,858 --> 01:57:41,178
the possibility that the AIDS virus would
interact with the cytomegalovirus which is

1886
01:57:41,178 --> 01:57:42,588
her core competency.

1887
01:57:43,338 --> 01:57:50,478
And [...] one was a guy that had participated
in the very first proof of concept

1888
01:57:50,898 --> 01:57:53,478
of the use of this firefly gene

1889
01:57:53,868 --> 01:57:57,558
for detecting gene expression
Suresh Subramaniam was his name.

1890
01:57:58,128 --> 01:58:02,848
And I spent my requisite
couple months in his lab he...

1891
01:58:02,933 --> 01:58:08,068
During the time he had just published the first
paper on the use of luciferase as a reporter gene.

1892
01:58:08,298 --> 01:58:10,878
And that turned out if
there's like one thing

1893
01:58:11,628 --> 01:58:15,318
that I could put my finger on that
said this is what made all this possible

1894
01:58:16,038 --> 01:58:23,148
it was that luciferase firefly gene and [...] it was
totally up, you know, ping pong the whole story is

1895
01:58:23,383 --> 01:58:32,358
is a story of [...], you know, truly being
surrounded by giants, intellectual giants and

1896
01:58:33,588 --> 01:58:38,328
this this amazing brew
of ideas and technology

1897
01:58:38,778 --> 01:58:43,578
that was coming out and so I did my
rotations there I did one with Enders Lab.

1898
01:58:44,388 --> 01:58:48,438
And [...] I talked to
Ted Friedman and

1899
01:58:48,798 --> 01:58:53,178
he said no no no I'm not going to take you
in my laboratory to do retroviral vectors

1900
01:58:53,568 --> 01:58:55,458
because they're
not working very well

1901
01:58:55,848 --> 01:58:59,898
and what I want you to do if you
want to come in here is developing

1902
01:59:00,078 --> 01:59:02,298
ordered cosmid library
of a chromosome.

1903
01:59:02,838 --> 01:59:06,828
And I'd spent plenty of time doing sequencing
and I thought that sound like the most

1904
01:59:06,828 --> 01:59:12,228
boring thing I could possibly
imagine and if I had done that

1905
01:59:12,678 --> 01:59:15,947
I would have been at the fourth front of
the human genome project, but you know it's

1906
01:59:15,947 --> 01:59:16,578
how it goes

1907
01:59:16,968 --> 01:59:20,868
and he was right probably in a lot of ways
that that [...] would have been a much more

1908
01:59:20,868 --> 01:59:23,158
appropriate career track.

1909
01:59:24,078 --> 01:59:26,178
But I really wanted
to do gene therapy.

1910
01:59:26,688 --> 01:59:33,858
And so, Ender's lab is across the street that, with
Salk, is an amazing place, it's brutalist architecture.

1911
01:59:34,728 --> 01:59:38,328
But [...] fantastic with
[...] really elements of

1912
01:59:38,748 --> 01:59:42,168
kind of Persian garden in it
it's got this little water trough and

1913
01:59:42,408 --> 01:59:45,798
marble and everything, sits on
the cliff in La Jolla, it's very amazing,

1914
01:59:46,098 --> 01:59:51,198
imposing and really
a temple to vaccines.

1915
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:54,078
On [...] the cliffs in La Jolla.

1916
01:59:54,888 --> 02:00:01,818
And the chance to work there, I was just
[...] overwhelmed [...] by that opportunity.

1917
02:00:02,778 --> 02:00:09,738
But Indore's lab was a amazing pressure cooker
[...] and no graduate students and I'm the little

1918
02:00:10,128 --> 02:00:13,128
graduate student in the
corner and doing weird stuff

1919
02:00:14,058 --> 02:00:16,548
outside of the mainstream of
the main focus the laboratory.

1920
02:00:17,058 --> 02:00:20,401
And one of the postdocs kind of took me
under his wing a little bit a guy named

1921
02:00:20,426 --> 02:00:22,338
Dan St. Louis, he's still in San Diego.

1922
02:00:22,968 --> 02:00:27,888
And he was doing a series of studies
where he was taking retroviruses

1923
02:00:28,308 --> 02:00:29,958
putting him into mouse cells

1924
02:00:30,588 --> 02:00:33,618
causing those mouse cells
to contract into a little ball

1925
02:00:33,918 --> 02:00:38,208
in cell culture and then implanting
them into a mouse, okay?

1926
02:00:38,718 --> 02:00:43,848
And hopefully [...] these
transplanted cells will

1927
02:00:44,028 --> 02:00:48,648
continue to produce the protein that the
retroviral vector had conferred so this was

1928
02:00:48,648 --> 02:00:52,218
a gene therapies type
study structure question.

1929
02:00:52,908 --> 02:00:59,748
[...] And Dan went through all this and the
cell culture and whatnot in the mice and

1930
02:01:00,498 --> 02:01:06,168
And they only produce the protein for about
three weeks and this was a big conundrum.

1931
02:01:07,038 --> 02:01:11,238
A lot of the focus of the laboratory was on
fundamentals of gene expression and [...]

1932
02:01:11,238 --> 02:01:13,458
so normally, you know,
as you would expect

1933
02:01:13,818 --> 02:01:17,058
everybody's spine went to, oh, there
must be something fancy going on

1934
02:01:17,388 --> 02:01:19,188
about gene expression control.

1935
02:01:20,836 --> 02:01:26,501
And I kind of dug out the medical
textbooks and [...] came to the conclusion

1936
02:01:26,525 --> 02:01:28,998
"No no no, this is an
immune response."

1937
02:01:29,748 --> 02:01:33,018
Because the timeline.
Against the foreign protein.

1938
02:01:34,578 --> 02:01:35,578
Which was heresy.

1939
02:01:36,678 --> 02:01:42,498
Because if that was the case, it would call
into question the whole logic of gene therapy.

1940
02:01:43,218 --> 02:01:51,918
Because [...] the basic idea is that you take, for
instance, [...] Ted Friedman came up with the idea.

1941
02:01:52,458 --> 02:01:53,458
He's a pediatrician.

1942
02:01:53,628 --> 02:01:58,558
So the idea was how to correct inborn
errors of metabolism [...] in infants

1943
02:01:58,998 --> 02:02:00,018
in a pediatric environment?

1944
02:02:00,738 --> 02:02:04,278
People that have genetic defects like
cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy.

1945
02:02:04,608 --> 02:02:05,928
What they hadn't
thought through

1946
02:02:06,288 --> 02:02:07,998
was that if you
take the good gene

1947
02:02:08,988 --> 02:02:10,908
that would not have the disease

1948
02:02:11,058 --> 02:02:12,678
and transfer it
into the patient

1949
02:02:13,898 --> 02:02:19,418
the patients immune system wouldn't see that as a good
gene or bad gene, they would see it as a different gene.

1950
02:02:20,054 --> 02:02:23,744
And they'd mount an immune response
against it that's what Dan's work showed.

1951
02:02:24,944 --> 02:02:28,975
And that was heresy because it meant the
whole house of cards, the logic structure

1952
02:02:28,975 --> 02:02:30,794
around gene therapy would fall.

1953
02:02:31,574 --> 02:02:33,824
And it did, over the
next three or four years.

1954
02:02:35,414 --> 02:02:40,934
But [...] I had this insight and
[...] so what do you do with that?

1955
02:02:41,065 --> 02:02:44,264
You know, I've come into this all
passionate this is going to be my life.

1956
02:02:45,044 --> 02:02:49,885
And [...] but I had some background in
vaccines and so the aha moment was

1957
02:02:49,909 --> 02:02:53,894
Oh, we can, I like to say, we
could make lemonade out of lemons.

1958
02:02:54,674 --> 02:02:57,083
We can use gene
therapy technologies for

1959
02:02:57,108 --> 02:03:01,340
purposes of eliciting a
vaccine immune response.

1960
02:03:01,364 --> 02:03:05,564
And so that, kind of, set
that whole thing in motion.

1961
02:03:05,744 --> 02:03:08,504
- And it says that. That is the
breakthrough, right? I mean it's basically

1962
02:03:08,834 --> 02:03:12,434
[...] you use a great analogy
of the lemons into lemonade.

1963
02:03:12,764 --> 02:03:15,104
It was, this was a
discouraging result.

1964
02:03:15,764 --> 02:03:20,834
In less [...] you say well maybe there's
a actually a positive function to what we're

1965
02:03:20,834 --> 02:03:23,601
observing even though it's not what you were hoping for.
- Yeah, exactly.

1966
02:03:23,625 --> 02:03:26,804
- And [...] that's how you
basically came to this idea of...

1967
02:03:26,924 --> 02:03:30,460
- So, sort of read forward
that the senior postdoc

1968
02:03:30,485 --> 02:03:33,260
in the lab was this guy
named Dinko Valerio.

1969
02:03:33,284 --> 02:03:39,917
And Dinko [...] had moved beyond retroviral
technology and what is at the very forefront

1970
02:03:39,941 --> 02:03:41,274
(this is late eighties)

1971
02:03:41,714 --> 02:03:47,174
[...] of this new technology for gene
transfer called adenoviral vectors.

1972
02:03:48,674 --> 02:03:52,394
And... so he was pioneering
this at the time in Ender's lab.

1973
02:03:53,414 --> 02:03:57,674
And... when he left the lab he
formed a company called Crucell.

1974
02:03:58,244 --> 02:03:59,864
Focused on gene therapy.

1975
02:04:00,524 --> 02:04:06,524
And [...] I left the lab and had my excursions
and we met back about three years later

1976
02:04:06,914 --> 02:04:08,774
at a gene therapy conference.

1977
02:04:09,284 --> 02:04:12,224
And he came to me and he said
Robert you know that you were right.

1978
02:04:14,114 --> 02:04:17,084
I'm going to take Crusell and

1979
02:04:17,444 --> 02:04:21,824
and stop the focus on being a gene therapy
company and turn it into a vaccine company.

1980
02:04:23,054 --> 02:04:24,884
Crusell got sold to J&J.

1981
02:04:26,384 --> 02:04:31,064
And that is the technology that still the
same cell line that they used for producing

1982
02:04:31,064 --> 02:04:34,454
the J&J vaccine for Covid.

1983
02:04:34,784 --> 02:04:35,234
- Wow.

1984
02:04:35,693 --> 02:04:39,284
- So both, all of these vaccines
all trace back to kind of that...

1985
02:04:40,094 --> 02:04:43,334
"Bing" moment [...] at the Salk

1986
02:04:43,454 --> 02:04:48,404
which was, you know, not what anybody was
looking for it wasn't where Ender's was at.

1987
02:04:48,944 --> 02:04:56,234
And I filed patent disclosures on [...]
use of RNA as drug and other things.

1988
02:04:56,834 --> 02:05:00,884
As [...] this was proceeding...
So Dan had his thing

1989
02:05:01,664 --> 02:05:03,884
and that was the
start of the thread of

1990
02:05:04,004 --> 02:05:06,974
vaccine out of gene
therapy, kind of, ok?

1991
02:05:08,174 --> 02:05:10,214
But the RNA work kept going on...

1992
02:05:10,624 --> 02:05:13,261
- You did get published
though I think, yeah.

1993
02:05:13,286 --> 02:05:18,014
- So the [...] PNAS paper
was way ahead of it's time.

1994
02:05:18,784 --> 02:05:20,904
- What year was that published?

1995
02:05:21,194 --> 02:05:22,244
- 1989.

1996
02:05:22,694 --> 02:05:26,474
- And that's the earliest published
reference we could find right now.

1997
02:05:27,044 --> 02:05:32,114
- Yeah, so some claim that there is an earlier
reference from about eight years before.

1998
02:05:32,504 --> 02:05:33,554
That is relevant.

1999
02:05:33,944 --> 02:05:36,644
There was a... that I was
completely ignorant about.

2000
02:05:36,944 --> 02:05:40,784
but you know ignorance that is
no... no files, no patents were filed

2001
02:05:40,934 --> 02:05:43,544
and from that no
claims were made.

2002
02:05:43,934 --> 02:05:50,924
It involved using classical liposomes
in RNA to prime immune responses

2003
02:05:51,224 --> 02:05:53,354
in cultured cells.

2004
02:05:53,504 --> 02:05:56,244
- It doesn't work with
classic liposomes, right?

2005
02:05:56,294 --> 02:06:00,534
- No, it doesn't. [...] And so
nothing ever came of that paper but...

2006
02:06:00,584 --> 02:06:04,154
Those, my detractors,
cite that as the prior art.

2007
02:06:04,604 --> 02:06:08,054
So I acknowledge that that [...]
exists. I didn't know it at the time.

2008
02:06:08,474 --> 02:06:10,454
And it's a very
different technology so...

2009
02:06:10,784 --> 02:06:16,304
- Basically your seminal paper was 89, you
are also listed on the patents as an inventor?

2010
02:06:16,634 --> 02:06:19,544
- Yes, so the Salk
ended up filing a patent

2011
02:06:19,964 --> 02:06:25,214
And... so I had done all these patent
disclosures on RNA as a drug etc.

2012
02:06:25,964 --> 02:06:29,744
And they had gone through a formal
process of determining who is to be the

2013
02:06:29,744 --> 02:06:32,537
inventor because this is
central to a patent to share

2014
02:06:32,570 --> 02:06:36,044
[...] if you don't have people
who should be inventors,

2015
02:06:36,434 --> 02:06:37,904
the patent can be disqualified

2016
02:06:38,144 --> 02:06:43,434
and if you include people who aren't qualified to
be inventors then the patent can be disallowed.

2017
02:06:43,664 --> 02:06:45,134
'key? So it's
important thing to do.

2018
02:06:45,944 --> 02:06:47,786
And they'd gone
through this process and

2019
02:06:47,811 --> 02:06:50,870
determined that Ender
was not an inventor.

2020
02:06:50,894 --> 02:06:52,964
But then Ender
had objected to that.

2021
02:06:54,554 --> 02:06:57,374
And so in the end they
filed a patent in which

2022
02:06:57,764 --> 02:07:00,914
they named Ender and
myself as the inventors.

2023
02:07:01,574 --> 02:07:06,224
Of RNA as a drug based on all this
technology and [...] formulations and stuff

2024
02:07:06,674 --> 02:07:11,714
and they sent it to me [...]
request, I got a copy of it in 1991.

2025
02:07:12,014 --> 02:07:13,304
They filed it in 89.

2026
02:07:13,699 --> 02:07:15,914
They actually filed it
on the same exact date.

2027
02:07:16,394 --> 02:07:19,484
That all of the Salk patent, I mean
all the Vical [Brickell Bio] patents were filed

2028
02:07:19,664 --> 02:07:20,664
which is an odd thing.

2029
02:07:21,464 --> 02:07:22,864
And that's another
part of the story.

2030
02:07:23,174 --> 02:07:28,164
but... they did file that.
And then they somehow

2031
02:07:28,364 --> 02:07:32,564
withdrew it but didn't tell me and
lost all records of having withdrawn it.

2032
02:07:33,464 --> 02:07:37,064
And so when they've been contacted about
this and, you know, trying to recreate the

2033
02:07:37,064 --> 02:07:41,414
history of this, their position is, basically,
"we don't know anything about this".

2034
02:07:43,274 --> 02:07:46,544
So I left. And what
happens next is the lawyers.

2035
02:07:47,234 --> 02:07:52,544
And I get plugged into a really high
quality lawyer in downtown San Diego.

2036
02:07:53,294 --> 02:07:54,554
And spend days with him.

2037
02:07:55,394 --> 02:07:59,894
Just, you know, just brain drain.
What can this be used for?

2038
02:08:00,194 --> 02:08:03,194
How can he use this new information?
- 'cause they want to file all this patents.

2039
02:08:05,384 --> 02:08:06,384
Did they get it warded?

2040
02:08:06,824 --> 02:08:12,763
- Yeah there's nine domestic US warded patents out of all that.
- All related to the mRNA technologies?

2041
02:08:12,787 --> 02:08:14,894
- And DNA.
- And DNA?
- Yeah.

2042
02:08:15,134 --> 02:08:17,114
Okay, so it's mRNA and DNA.

2043
02:08:17,594 --> 02:08:19,484
That is the basis.

2044
02:08:19,844 --> 02:08:23,414
For this, when we talk about
mRNA and DNA vaccines.

2045
02:08:24,104 --> 02:08:26,144
And those didn't come
out for a number of years

2046
02:08:26,354 --> 02:08:29,444
they were [...] the findings
were disclosed in [...]

2047
02:08:29,834 --> 02:08:33,554
these manuscripts and also
in various academic meetings.

2048
02:08:34,124 --> 02:08:37,934
And then [...] the technology was
sold to Merck. Part of the Merck deal

2049
02:08:38,294 --> 02:08:43,994
was that Merck got to take
credit... and... for the discovery.

2050
02:08:44,624 --> 02:08:51,054
And so there was a downplaying of what I had
done and the people that followed me immediately.

2051
02:08:51,404 --> 02:08:55,674
One is mentioned in the Atlantic
piece [Stan Gronkowski?] he's the one

2052
02:08:55,699 --> 02:08:58,760
that got the salty
statement at the very end.

2053
02:08:58,784 --> 02:09:02,504
Anybody that knows Stan knows that that
was his quote because that's pretty much

2054
02:09:02,504 --> 02:09:03,734
exactly how he speaks.

2055
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:10,224
Stan was brought in to do the cellular immunology
after I left. I left after about 4 months.

2056
02:09:10,484 --> 02:09:16,964
Frustrating that my ideas again were being
taken, other people were taking credit for them.

2057
02:09:17,444 --> 02:09:18,884
And you know I'd filed

2058
02:09:19,154 --> 02:09:22,994
another patent disclosure on a
nuance of making the RNA more stable

2059
02:09:23,444 --> 02:09:28,064
and had my supervisor counter sign [...] as
the inventor when he had not even understood it.

2060
02:09:28,484 --> 02:09:31,934
And I just was you know it's just
that's the environment though everybody

2061
02:09:32,204 --> 02:09:36,704
is so much of a pressure cooker and [...]
there is money and fame and everything else

2062
02:09:37,154 --> 02:09:38,154
on the line.

2063
02:09:38,227 --> 02:09:43,394
and all the ideas roll out
and the patents get filed.

2064
02:09:44,204 --> 02:09:49,424
And, like I said, there's like four of them
that all get filed on the same day that Enders,

2065
02:09:50,084 --> 02:09:51,524
the Salk one goes in.

2066
02:09:53,059 --> 02:09:56,984
And that forms the basis for the kind
of the new Vical [Brickell Bio] that wasn't part of the

2067
02:09:56,984 --> 02:09:57,614
business plan.

2068
02:09:57,824 --> 02:10:02,827
And Maurice Hilleman [...] this had
been pitched to him who is the great

2069
02:10:02,852 --> 02:10:06,734
vaccinologist that really
drove Merck vaccines,

2070
02:10:07,064 --> 02:10:08,924
you know, the pediatric
vaccines that we know of.

2071
02:10:09,614 --> 02:10:11,534
And he became enamored of it.

2072
02:10:12,224 --> 02:10:15,884
And... so the deal was
Vical [Brickell Bio] was cash strapped.

2073
02:10:16,274 --> 02:10:19,344
That I forget what they got, like, six
million bucks or something.

2074
02:10:19,368 --> 02:10:21,404
It wasn't a huge amount,
but at the time it was.

2075
02:10:21,914 --> 02:10:23,414
[...] For this tech.

2076
02:10:23,774 --> 02:10:27,254
Doug Richmond had setup all
the work and done the initial

2077
02:10:27,404 --> 02:10:29,714
built a team and done
the initial proof of concept.

2078
02:10:30,764 --> 02:10:32,294
Praising it for flu vaccines.

2079
02:10:32,894 --> 02:10:34,964
And a Merck swooped in and said

2080
02:10:35,144 --> 02:10:38,414
Okay, well, if we're gonna do this deal
we want to be able to take credit for this.

2081
02:10:39,254 --> 02:10:43,394
And so they took the work that
Doug and the Vical [Brickell Bio] team had done

2082
02:10:43,544 --> 02:10:45,944
and built off of the
work that I'd done.

2083
02:10:46,770 --> 02:10:53,024
And basically took it, reproduce some of the
experiments and put that as a science paper.

2084
02:10:53,954 --> 02:10:58,554
But put their own people as the first
and senior and that kind of stuff and...

2085
02:10:58,869 --> 02:11:04,844
Didn't even put Doug on it, Doug Richmond is
now an emeritus at UC San Diego and runs their

2086
02:11:05,324 --> 02:11:09,234
Aids group and that... so he's a
very senior, well established guy...

2087
02:11:09,284 --> 02:11:10,544
he still pissed off.

2088
02:11:10,694 --> 02:11:15,224
- Yeah, so you've got
publication that citeable, right?

2089
02:11:15,477 --> 02:11:19,844
I believe also it's referenced in other
subsequent publications, right? That people are

2090
02:11:19,844 --> 02:11:22,514
using you in their references
from the work that you did.

2091
02:11:23,474 --> 02:11:28,394
So it's there's [...] objectivity
around being able to say, well, okay

2092
02:11:28,664 --> 02:11:34,274
there's the story, but then there's [...] the
publication, the patents were filed etc that shows the

2093
02:11:34,274 --> 02:11:36,584
timeline of when you were
there [and what you were] doing.

2094
02:11:37,064 --> 02:11:41,414
- And then this comes to the present when I
get this phone call from a Swiss journalist

2095
02:11:41,414 --> 02:11:45,254
saying, I'd like to talk to you
because we think you were the first

2096
02:11:45,674 --> 02:11:49,034
and [...] I'm like, well, I haven't...
you know, thank you very much.

2097
02:11:50,774 --> 02:11:52,754
Actually the first time
I caught wind of this,

2098
02:11:53,156 --> 02:11:55,025
[...] that people were
going to acknowledge me,

2099
02:11:55,784 --> 02:11:58,604
was at a vaccines
conference that I was one of the

2100
02:11:58,724 --> 02:12:07,963
kind of organizers or chairs for up
in Boston, in, like, September 2019,

2101
02:12:07,988 --> 02:12:09,704
so right before the
outbreak happened.

2102
02:12:10,664 --> 02:12:14,834
And there was a presentation from a German
scientist that cited both of those papers.

2103
02:12:15,344 --> 02:12:17,384
And he was talking
about mRNA vaccines

2104
02:12:17,804 --> 02:12:21,554
and I was just blown away,
because it was the first time

2105
02:12:21,704 --> 02:12:26,398
I had been acknowledged, in memory.
I mean it brought tears to my eyes.

2106
02:12:27,455 --> 02:12:29,338
And this is, you
know, thirty years later.

2107
02:12:29,518 --> 02:12:33,478
And I'm not even sure he knew I
was in the room, he must have, but

2108
02:12:33,778 --> 02:12:37,138
he specifically called me out and
[...] I'd never had that experience.

2109
02:12:37,588 --> 02:12:39,718
Then I get this phone call
from the Swiss journalist.

2110
02:12:40,468 --> 02:12:43,018
And he wants documents.

2111
02:12:43,918 --> 02:12:50,128
And... so my wife pulls out, we've got boxes
and boxes the old data my old lab books and

2112
02:12:50,368 --> 02:12:52,888
the primary data the
actual disclosures,

2113
02:12:53,308 --> 02:12:55,858
[...] all of this stuff
the original documents

2114
02:12:56,308 --> 02:13:01,378
And... so she starts pulling it out for the
Swiss journalist and sending him copies of this

2115
02:13:01,378 --> 02:13:02,378
that and the other thing.

2116
02:13:02,758 --> 02:13:09,478
And then [...] she decides to [...] upload it
all on her website and write her own narrative

2117
02:13:10,018 --> 02:13:13,658
about what actually
happened. And...

2118
02:13:14,158 --> 02:13:18,778
[...] she so aggravated at the press putting
out these other stories that other people

2119
02:13:18,778 --> 02:13:23,188
that came about a decade later were
the ones that had [...] launched all this.

2120
02:13:23,878 --> 02:13:26,488
[...] that she takes
her narrative and

2121
02:13:26,728 --> 02:13:31,528
puts it into a mailchimp blast cause we've
got a mailing list of about 3-4 thousand,

2122
02:13:32,338 --> 02:13:36,059
You know, hardcore scientists that we built
up over the years for the consulting business

2123
02:13:36,358 --> 02:13:37,768
and she sends it
out to everybody.

2124
02:13:38,668 --> 02:13:41,463
And that just sparks off, yeah.

2125
02:13:41,488 --> 02:13:44,458
- Firestone.

2126
02:13:44,698 --> 02:13:47,578
- Yeah, because it's [...]
contrary to the dominant narrative

2127
02:13:47,698 --> 02:13:50,518
which gets back to our
you know core theme here.

2128
02:13:51,178 --> 02:13:56,578
[...] 'cause this has already been promoted by
BioNTech cause [Katalin Karikó?] Co is a BioNTech VP.

2129
02:13:57,298 --> 02:14:00,958
And promoted by upenn [University
of Pennsylvania]. Very aggressively.

2130
02:14:01,438 --> 02:14:06,148
Upenn has the patent on this
improvement about the use of pseudouridine

2131
02:14:06,778 --> 02:14:08,788
as opposed to
the standard uracil

2132
02:14:09,118 --> 02:14:14,368
[...] that makes the RNA somewhat less
immunogenic and makes it work a little bit better.

2133
02:14:15,028 --> 02:14:21,841
And the storyline that's been promoted is that
this is ascent and essential in enabling finding.

2134
02:14:21,865 --> 02:14:22,978
No, it's not.

2135
02:14:23,548 --> 02:14:27,208
As shown by the CureVac company
that doesn't use that technology.

2136
02:14:27,868 --> 02:14:33,058
And in my opinion [...] the true enabling
technology between then and now

2137
02:14:34,168 --> 02:14:40,348
was largely led by Pieter Cullis.
Pieter is never talked about.

2138
02:14:42,148 --> 02:14:45,358
Dr. Pieter Cullis and his team
at university of British Columbia.

2139
02:14:46,288 --> 02:14:48,988
And he spawned three or
four different companies there.

2140
02:14:49,858 --> 02:14:57,508
And that had to do with the nuance of the charge,
the nature of the chemical charge, the amine.

2141
02:14:59,008 --> 02:15:01,108
And he uses a tertiary amine,

2142
02:15:01,588 --> 02:15:06,748
that changes it's charge based on pH and
what we were using was a quaternary amine,

2143
02:15:07,348 --> 02:15:11,608
which is forced to always be positive
structurally in the organic chemistry.

2144
02:15:12,598 --> 02:15:16,188
That is then linked to the lipid that
condenses around the RNA.

2145
02:15:16,213 --> 02:15:21,958
So Pieter is, in his group, developed
this improved formulation method.

2146
02:15:23,038 --> 02:15:27,208
And many others have contributed [to] that also but
I think Pieter and his group get the most credit.

2147
02:15:27,508 --> 02:15:34,138
And that's what's made these amazingly
potent formulations for use in humans

2148
02:15:35,398 --> 02:15:37,798
that are built off
of that old idea so...

2149
02:15:38,068 --> 02:15:42,123
- Why was there... like, so we're going back thirty years or so...
- That question!

2150
02:15:42,148 --> 02:15:45,928
- Yeah, and suddenly
here we are and

2151
02:15:46,078 --> 02:15:50,038
yet these things are being rushed to market.
[...] Why did it take thirty years to get

2152
02:15:50,038 --> 02:15:53,018
them developed to a point
where... Is there something that's...?

2153
02:15:53,158 --> 02:15:55,858
- That's a great question and I
think there's going to be other

2154
02:15:57,178 --> 02:16:00,368
media coming out about that.

2155
02:16:00,448 --> 02:16:04,358
It might even be one in nature, I'm not sure,
I know that there's an article being written.

2156
02:16:05,668 --> 02:16:15,238
So what happened was that Vical [Brickell Bio] and then Merck
buys it, has this enormously broad patent estate.

2157
02:16:16,378 --> 02:16:17,668
That covers the whole domain.

2158
02:16:19,288 --> 02:16:20,518
In terms of the

2159
02:16:20,818 --> 02:16:24,328
applications and the concepts and
the fundamental formulation, everything.

2160
02:16:25,228 --> 02:16:26,758
And they sell it to Merck.

2161
02:16:27,268 --> 02:16:29,608
Merck spend something
like a billion dollars

2162
02:16:29,728 --> 02:16:34,108
to try to develop a product but they make a
strategic decision and Vical [Brickell Bio] did also.

2163
02:16:34,708 --> 02:16:39,308
[...] When I left basically I don't think there
was anybody that was very good at making RNA.

2164
02:16:39,868 --> 02:16:41,228
[...] I think that's
what happened.

2165
02:16:42,538 --> 02:16:45,358
And... but DNA is easy to
make, dead easy [to] make.

2166
02:16:46,288 --> 02:16:48,808
In so they thought,
"Okay, RNA, DNA".

2167
02:16:49,428 --> 02:16:50,518
We can do this with DNA.

2168
02:16:50,668 --> 02:16:53,908
And it does, DNA vaccination
works really good in mice.

2169
02:16:54,658 --> 02:16:55,658
So why not.

2170
02:16:56,788 --> 02:16:57,788
So Vicals [Brickell Bio]

2171
02:16:57,928 --> 02:17:01,288
made the decision to just focus
on the DNA not on the RNA.

2172
02:17:02,608 --> 02:17:08,068
And then Merck mirrored that decision when they
bought the rights and they only focused on the DNA

2173
02:17:08,068 --> 02:17:12,754
they ended up going up to a milligram in
injection and they never could get it to work.

2174
02:17:12,778 --> 02:17:18,698
And this is true with many others
they chase [...] the DNA for years.

2175
02:17:20,158 --> 02:17:23,398
But what Vical [Brickell
Bio] and Merck also did

2176
02:17:23,608 --> 02:17:28,408
was they very aggresively kept anybody else
from developing anything that was covered [by] any

2177
02:17:28,408 --> 02:17:29,128
of those patents.

2178
02:17:29,308 --> 02:17:31,558
Typical pharmaceutical
industry behaviors.

2179
02:17:31,948 --> 02:17:35,938
Including sending me as a young academic
then, by that point, after I finished my

2180
02:17:35,938 --> 02:17:38,428
medical school and gone
back and started a lab.

2181
02:17:39,418 --> 02:17:41,338
Sending me [per
cease?] and desist letters.

2182
02:17:41,758 --> 02:17:45,238
Saying that I should not work on anything
that I was working on before because that

2183
02:17:45,238 --> 02:17:47,188
was the terms and
conditions of my employment.

2184
02:17:47,878 --> 02:17:50,938
People are... sometimes people
say, well, didn't you get rich from this?

2185
02:17:51,328 --> 02:17:55,928
No, [...] I got one Susan B.
Anthony dollar for the patents.

2186
02:17:56,248 --> 02:17:58,558
So no, I didn't get
any money out of this.

2187
02:17:59,038 --> 02:18:00,038
Still don't.

2188
02:18:00,330 --> 02:18:04,198
- Yeah, and a lot of people I think would try to
assert, oh, well, it's just sour grapes that's why

2189
02:18:04,198 --> 02:18:05,087
you're talking about this

2190
02:18:05,111 --> 02:18:08,068
but here's what I'm
taking away from all this:

2191
02:18:09,208 --> 02:18:12,868
Your experience
in the realm is vast.

2192
02:18:13,648 --> 02:18:17,848
You were in the heart of it all
when this stuff was going on.

2193
02:18:18,958 --> 02:18:23,158
You've got publication and the publication is
cited, and it's really the earliest except for

2194
02:18:23,158 --> 02:18:26,458
the other thing that you've mentioned that
really has a technology that doesn't work

2195
02:18:26,578 --> 02:18:27,578
with the liposome.

2196
02:18:28,218 --> 02:18:31,918
[...] you've got patents
and [...] so your trail is [...]

2197
02:18:32,548 --> 02:18:36,737
observable through all of this.
- And then there's all the primary [data?].
- Yeah, yeah and all the...

2198
02:18:37,588 --> 02:18:41,668
That completes part one my three
part interview with dr Robert Malone

2199
02:18:41,818 --> 02:18:46,318
we've established the past now really well
to know how things unfolded over time when

2200
02:18:46,318 --> 02:18:48,178
it comes to this mRNA vaccine.

2201
02:18:48,508 --> 02:18:50,158
Now we're going
to start discussing

2202
02:18:50,278 --> 02:18:54,958
what it means to you and I today you don't
want to miss these next two parts they're

2203
02:18:54,958 --> 02:18:56,368
coming up later in the series

2204
02:18:56,548 --> 02:18:57,548
thanks for being here.

2205
02:19:11,898 --> 02:19:15,273
Patient Stories

2206
02:19:18,550 --> 02:19:23,698
Erin, thanks so much for taking the time to
have this conversation and to share your story.

2207
02:19:24,598 --> 02:19:28,768
Let's just start back with what [...] were
you doing in your life and career before

2208
02:19:28,768 --> 02:19:30,209
you decided to have
a Covid vaccine?

2209
02:19:31,048 --> 02:19:34,108
- I'm a homecare
speech pathologist.

2210
02:19:35,068 --> 02:19:39,928
So I've been working all through the pandemic.
I was one of those people out driving

2211
02:19:40,048 --> 02:19:41,878
around when it was a ghost town

2212
02:19:42,358 --> 02:19:43,678
and everything was closed.

2213
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:48,358
So I had been working right up
until the vaccines were available.

2214
02:19:49,708 --> 02:19:53,398
I have two children, 13 and 10.

2215
02:19:53,903 --> 02:19:56,818
And I have a dog, I have
a step daughter who's 8

2216
02:19:57,058 --> 02:19:59,038
so we have a very
full busy house.

2217
02:20:00,178 --> 02:20:05,548
And I was just working
up to being a runner again.

2218
02:20:05,848 --> 02:20:14,758
I was working out. I was getting really into training
my jog and hiking and doing all of that sort of stuff.

2219
02:20:14,998 --> 02:20:17,068
So I have a very
active household.

2220
02:20:17,488 --> 02:20:22,016
So what caused you to want to go ahead and
get the vaccine?

2221
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:25,619
What was your like frame of reference at
that point that said I'm going to go do this?

2222
02:20:26,008 --> 02:20:31,618
- I am very trusting of doctors
and healthcare in general.

2223
02:20:31,888 --> 02:20:35,278
So I have never
questioned any vaccines.

2224
02:20:35,479 --> 02:20:40,288
You know, working for hospitals that sends
their certain vaccine requirements that we have

2225
02:20:40,708 --> 02:20:42,658
and when they tell me, hey, it's

2226
02:20:42,778 --> 02:20:46,348
time to come in and get this
vaccine, I don't think twice just do it.

2227
02:20:46,858 --> 02:20:49,018
I've just never questioned them.

2228
02:20:50,128 --> 02:20:51,718
I had blind faith.

2229
02:20:51,838 --> 02:20:57,988
And I had such blind faith that I
was excited to be one of the first.

2230
02:20:58,438 --> 02:21:02,938
- Well and did you even like try to
distinguish whether you're getting, you know,

2231
02:21:03,178 --> 02:21:09,657
Moderna or Pfizer or J&J or..?
- No, we [...] didn't have a choice. So when I went it was Moderna.

2232
02:21:09,718 --> 02:21:15,818
So that's the one that I got and I got it
through the hospital system that I work for.

2233
02:21:16,408 --> 02:21:17,908
- When did you
have your first dose?

2234
02:21:18,958 --> 02:21:20,098
- January 6th.

2235
02:21:20,548 --> 02:21:24,016
- So roughly 10 months ago
or so and...
- Yes, yes.

2236
02:21:24,041 --> 02:21:26,278
- [...] What did you
experience after that?

2237
02:21:26,848 --> 02:21:29,728
- So I had an
immediate reaction...

2238
02:21:29,908 --> 02:21:34,708
about 5 minutes after I had the
injection I had a very bad headache.

2239
02:21:35,278 --> 02:21:40,288
It wasn't anything to report to the
staff at the time, wasn't of any concern.

2240
02:21:40,528 --> 02:21:43,018
I'd never got headaches so...

2241
02:21:43,532 --> 02:21:47,998
In my mind I was sort of like "Oh
my gosh, what just went in me?"

2242
02:21:48,358 --> 02:21:59,528
[...] And that evolved in the next couple of days
into nausia, the headaches persisted, fatigue.

2243
02:21:59,998 --> 02:22:06,148
Just having to be in bed. I mean, I was
probably in bed for at least 3 weeks straight.

2244
02:22:06,228 --> 02:22:11,588
You know, just getting out to go to the bathroom and
I was missing, I was a missing mom in my bedroom.

2245
02:22:11,668 --> 02:22:15,328
[...] just so sick and
every week that went by

2246
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:19,408
[...] my husband and I would look at
each other and say "what is going on?".

2247
02:22:19,708 --> 02:22:20,908
What is happening?

2248
02:22:21,328 --> 02:22:26,338
And then it started just sort of
turning into, like, cycles of symptoms

2249
02:22:26,608 --> 02:22:28,845
so I would have good
days and bad days.

2250
02:22:28,869 --> 02:22:32,158
I never would know when
there was a good day or bad day.

2251
02:22:33,208 --> 02:22:35,878
But the bad days
were [...] many in a row.

2252
02:22:36,058 --> 02:22:40,239
So I was out of work for
about three and a half months.

2253
02:22:40,510 --> 02:22:42,048
- Did you talk to your
doctors, you know,

2254
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:45,910
say, hey, I'm having, like, I'm
exhausted, I can't get out of bed.

2255
02:22:46,360 --> 02:22:47,470
and explained that you

2256
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:50,170
were... felt like this was an
adverse reaction to the vaccine?

2257
02:22:50,980 --> 02:22:55,510
- I did and I [...] think being in
healthcare I kind of have always been

2258
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:59,500
right on top of who
to go to, who to talk to.

2259
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:02,950
So I went to my
primary care doctor, who

2260
02:23:03,310 --> 02:23:07,210
just said, you know, I'm not sure
what's going on, it could be anything.

2261
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:12,580
And he was willing to refer me out to
wherever I thought I needed. So I asked to be

2262
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:14,140
seen by an immunologist.

2263
02:23:14,830 --> 02:23:19,820
And this is one of the reasons why I
find it so important to tell these stories.

2264
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:24,850
It is because doctors even today

2265
02:23:25,090 --> 02:23:29,830
when someone has a reaction to the first
are encouraging people to get the second

2266
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:33,760
without any knowledge
that that's a mistake

2267
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:36,820
- So they recommended that you get
the second dose? And what happened?

2268
02:23:37,690 --> 02:23:41,530
- They did. So I got the second dose
and it made things much much worse.

2269
02:23:41,890 --> 02:23:47,530
[...] it was a similar reaction at
first in that my symptoms came back

2270
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:51,040
Worse than they
were at that time

2271
02:23:51,190 --> 02:23:53,890
but just like they
did after the first dose.

2272
02:23:54,220 --> 02:24:01,180
But as time went on the reason it was worse
is I developed many many many more symptoms.

2273
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:03,220
I had pain in my heart.

2274
02:24:03,850 --> 02:24:08,860
I had [...] debilitating
weakness in my muscles,

2275
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:13,630
where, you know, if I walked up a flight of
stairs, I felt like I had just run a race.

2276
02:24:14,470 --> 02:24:16,870
My heart rate
was out of control.

2277
02:24:17,230 --> 02:24:19,570
When I would stand
it will go very high.

2278
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:25,750
I was getting [...] just as high
level of, like, fight or flight feeling.

2279
02:24:25,774 --> 02:24:31,540
I was also have sleeping a lot,
probably sleeping 12 to 15 hours a day.

2280
02:24:31,930 --> 02:24:36,310
[...] there were just a huge
list of symptoms between pain,

2281
02:24:36,670 --> 02:24:39,940
tingling in my hands
and feet and up my legs.

2282
02:24:40,270 --> 02:24:41,920
I just seemed to be...

2283
02:24:42,310 --> 02:24:46,870
That there was no rhyme or reason. I had
any or all of these symptoms at any time.

2284
02:24:47,050 --> 02:24:52,240
- Did anybody suggest to you that since you
had such a bad reaction to the first shot maybe

2285
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:56,200
it's not a good idea to go for the second one
or [...] just said, no, you go ahead and do

2286
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:57,200
it anyway?

2287
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:59,590
- I think my
primary care doctor

2288
02:25:00,010 --> 02:25:02,530
didn't exactly say
that but he was maybe

2289
02:25:03,070 --> 02:25:05,969
think saying to think
cautiously but I chose

2290
02:25:05,994 --> 02:25:08,440
to follow the advice of the specialists.
- Yeah.

2291
02:25:08,830 --> 02:25:10,630
- My husband didn't
want me to get it.

2292
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:13,550
- Well, so somebody had. And
that's what I'm wondering, because

2293
02:25:13,750 --> 02:25:17,680
sometimes it's [...] other people, other
than the medical professional people,

2294
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:20,920
that might say, hey, I'm
a little concerned here.

2295
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:23,680
And it's kind of interesting
that the logic of a husband

2296
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:27,790
might actually be better than
the logic of the specialist but...

2297
02:25:28,240 --> 02:25:31,930
[...] I guess it just, you know, in hindsight
because like you said [...] you've got this

2298
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:36,580
you know, vaccine. It's still only
authorized under emergency use [...]

2299
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:38,410
Yeah, so it's
basically experimental.

2300
02:25:38,710 --> 02:25:40,870
You have a bad reaction
to a shot, you know.

2301
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:44,691
It's kind of, like, maybe you shouldn't go
back for another one and yet there's still

2302
02:25:44,757 --> 02:25:48,130
kind of [...], you know, pushing that
saying, oh, no, you should go back.

2303
02:25:48,430 --> 02:25:49,430
How are you now?

2304
02:25:49,660 --> 02:25:53,653
In other words, so here you are, you know, all
these months later what [...] your life like?

2305
02:25:53,677 --> 02:25:54,610
What your symptoms like?

2306
02:25:54,880 --> 02:26:00,790
- Well my progression of this is a
little different than everyone else's.

2307
02:26:00,910 --> 02:26:03,700
[...] I've actually
been diagnosed with

2308
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:08,440
[...] genetic disorder called
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome [EDS].

2309
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:12,100
And they believe it was
triggered by the vaccine.

2310
02:26:13,422 --> 02:26:17,230
And it also triggered
some mast cell activation

2311
02:26:17,380 --> 02:26:21,250
which has been pretty common with
folks who have been injured by the vaccine.

2312
02:26:21,700 --> 02:26:24,240
So they believe that
the vaccine may have

2313
02:26:24,265 --> 02:26:27,826
caused [...] these
mast cells to activate

2314
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:31,210
and since they, the mast cells,
live in the connective tissue.

2315
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:34,540
Ehlers-Danlos is a
connective tissue disorder

2316
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:38,080
and so they believe that
that triggered Ehlers-Danlos.

2317
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:43,240
So it's a diagnosis that I
would have had my whole life.

2318
02:26:43,990 --> 02:26:48,370
But I never knew I had it I would have
never known I had it I would have never

2319
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:52,330
been suffering the way I
am if not for the vaccine.

2320
02:26:52,696 --> 02:26:55,345
The vaccine sort
of ruined my life.

2321
02:26:55,369 --> 02:26:58,510
I know that I look ok okay

2322
02:26:59,650 --> 02:27:05,050
but there's a lot of work that goes into
me being able to do this with you today.

2323
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:07,750
Since I have such

2324
02:27:08,050 --> 02:27:12,880
serious reactions to foods and chemicals
and things, you know, I had to make sure

2325
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:16,780
that I didn't eat yet today, that
I've been drinking enough water

2326
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:21,010
and I made sure that I
got enough sleep last night

2327
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:22,990
and everything is very

2328
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:27,610
manipulated and controlled
so that I can just function

2329
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:31,332
with the basic stuff.
I mean I'm working

2330
02:27:31,630 --> 02:27:33,940
and after work, I'm in bed.

2331
02:27:34,690 --> 02:27:40,420
- So you had all this happen and I
guess, you know, at this point unlike

2332
02:27:40,570 --> 02:27:42,610
some other people, I've
interviewed many others,

2333
02:27:43,180 --> 02:27:46,000
at least they're saying there's
some kind of diagnosis. Many of them

2334
02:27:46,108 --> 02:27:49,210
they just say, well, we can't really
find anything wrong, yet they're suffering,

2335
02:27:49,279 --> 02:27:50,710
they're tremoring,
[...] having

2336
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:55,030
similar issues in the way of autonomic
response, it seems like [...] their autonomic

2337
02:27:55,030 --> 02:27:57,010
systems are on fire and
they're sweating and they're

2338
02:27:57,640 --> 02:27:59,800
expressing a lot of things
that you just described.

2339
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:02,170
Did this get reported
as an adverse event?

2340
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:03,160
- Yes

2341
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:08,350
I've called Moderna and I have reported
to VAERS and I've also reported to that

2342
02:28:08,350 --> 02:28:11,440
system that text
you for updates.

2343
02:28:12,010 --> 02:28:13,840
- So with [...] VAERS,

2344
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:17,860
did you have to report it yourself, [...] you
went online and actually had to go through

2345
02:28:17,860 --> 02:28:19,835
and report yourself or did
the doctors did that for you?

2346
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:21,160
- I reported it.

2347
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:26,110
- And how difficult process
was [...] or it was not that difficult?

2348
02:28:26,350 --> 02:28:30,520
- Well, for me it wasn't that
difficult, but I found out recently

2349
02:28:30,850 --> 02:28:33,940
and through someone who
spoke to the people at VAERS

2350
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:40,480
that they actually prefer you go in
and enter each symptom individually.

2351
02:28:40,900 --> 02:28:47,365
So if I had done the correct thing I would
have put in you know maybe 15 to 20 symptoms.

2352
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:49,690
That would have
been rather difficult.

2353
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:55,900
- Yeah, and I guess [...] it's kind of laborious
that if you have to try to do all that.

2354
02:28:56,440 --> 02:29:00,220
So at this point in the way that you report
to VAERS they don't really understand

2355
02:29:00,220 --> 02:29:02,188
the full spectrum of
what's going on with

2356
02:29:02,213 --> 02:29:03,730
you they just kind of
have a highlighter to.

2357
02:29:04,480 --> 02:29:07,060
- Right, right. And
then Moderna did

2358
02:29:07,810 --> 02:29:12,820
send paperwork back asking for more
information which I sent to them, maybe,

2359
02:29:13,180 --> 02:29:16,240
two months ago and
never heard anything back.

2360
02:29:16,570 --> 02:29:20,309
- Really? Does anybody have
potential solutions for you?

2361
02:29:20,333 --> 02:29:22,720
I mean, [...] what's the
prognosis? Do you feel like you

2362
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:26,650
might be able to somehow detox

2363
02:29:26,860 --> 02:29:31,480
the effects [...] of this vaccine out of your
system or people just trying to say, well,

2364
02:29:31,480 --> 02:29:36,340
let's just best manage, you know, these
adverse events that occurred for you?

2365
02:29:36,940 --> 02:29:43,270
- I mean [...] no doctor has been
willing to say anything, like, any of that.

2366
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:49,180
I had a different take on things.
I used my medical insurance to

2367
02:29:49,510 --> 02:29:54,880
See doctors for maybe
the first five months or so.

2368
02:29:55,210 --> 02:30:00,010
And I had doctors telling me that
it was anxiety, it was in my head.

2369
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:01,750
I even had one doctor

2370
02:30:01,870 --> 02:30:04,180
hold my hands and
tell me to try yoga.

2371
02:30:05,770 --> 02:30:06,970
You know there were just...

2372
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:12,160
It was just absurd and I think, I was
getting a better response from them because

2373
02:30:12,550 --> 02:30:18,280
I look things up, I kind of know what things
are, I work in the general healthcare field

2374
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:22,060
So it's not like they
weren't really believing me,

2375
02:30:22,510 --> 02:30:23,800
but they weren't believing me.

2376
02:30:24,670 --> 02:30:27,100
And so I started
to pay privately

2377
02:30:27,310 --> 02:30:29,255
and that's actually
how I found out about

2378
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:32,356
the Ehlers-Danlos. I
mean, I've probably paid

2379
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:36,250
4000 dollars towards my
deductible and I've probably paid

2380
02:30:36,370 --> 02:30:38,290
several thousand dollars

2381
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:43,030
above that to see people privately
and I'll tell you once you start paying

2382
02:30:43,930 --> 02:30:47,200
specialists privately, you
start getting what you need.

2383
02:30:47,350 --> 02:30:52,480
I was referred by a specialist
to a functional neurologist.

2384
02:30:53,410 --> 02:30:59,620
Who was a chiropractor and
he actually made my life livable.

2385
02:31:00,152 --> 02:31:05,210
I told him he was the first
person to actually test me

2386
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:12,310
to actually look at me to see me move to
see me balancing to see how my eyes tracked

2387
02:31:12,580 --> 02:31:20,560
and he found [...] things through
that testing that rang so true to me

2388
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:26,440
little things that I hadn't really told
anybody that were, I felt, were [awful] wrong.

2389
02:31:26,995 --> 02:31:28,720
That he picked up
around right away.

2390
02:31:28,900 --> 02:31:35,230
I had postural orthostatic tachycardia
so my heart rate was going really high.

2391
02:31:35,590 --> 02:31:41,170
This meant I was laying down all the time
I couldn't even really tolerate sitting up.

2392
02:31:41,650 --> 02:31:47,770
[...] I went to see him for about
four weeks or so 4-5 weeks

2393
02:31:48,070 --> 02:31:51,820
and he made the
tachycardia go away.

2394
02:31:52,014 --> 02:31:53,014
- Wow.

2395
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:55,180
- So he made my life livable.

2396
02:31:55,750 --> 02:32:00,490
And there were a lot of symptoms that
were much more severe when I had that

2397
02:32:01,150 --> 02:32:05,020
heart rate raising all the time,
my nausea was unbearable

2398
02:32:05,350 --> 02:32:10,120
and even though I still have nausea,
he made it much less and he made it so I

2399
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:11,290
could go back to work.

2400
02:32:11,950 --> 02:32:17,350
I'll never forget him because, I mean,
he changed how my life was going.

2401
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:20,200
- Well, [...] I'm
glad that you found

2402
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:24,280
at least a part of a solution to
[...] go from unlivable to livable.

2403
02:32:25,270 --> 02:32:28,660
And I'll just say that there may
be more help out there for you that

2404
02:32:29,170 --> 02:32:31,330
you know, people that
approach things a bit differently.

2405
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:33,880
So I'm really glad that
you found that support.

2406
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:40,542
So [...] again [...] I wish for you to
heal and I wish you to get better.

2407
02:32:40,750 --> 02:32:43,750
And I also again appreciate
your courage and

2408
02:32:44,200 --> 02:32:46,090
sitting here right now
and sharing your story.

2409
02:32:46,330 --> 02:32:47,330
- Thank you.

2410
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:49,000
- Thank you.
- I'm happy to do it.

2411
02:33:00,580 --> 02:33:04,900
Well, that concludes episode one of
our nine part docu series Covid Revealed

2412
02:33:05,230 --> 02:33:09,610
and we are just getting started as you
can see powerful powerful information

2413
02:33:09,730 --> 02:33:11,230
from extraordinary experts.

2414
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:13,992
There's a lot more
ground to cover we're still in

2415
02:33:14,017 --> 02:33:16,150
the very beginning of
the free viewing period

2416
02:33:16,360 --> 02:33:18,880
if you haven't
already please share

2417
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:22,510
with other people so they can
join us they can get this information

2418
02:33:22,750 --> 02:33:23,890
and we together

2419
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:26,320
can take this
journey, learn more,

2420
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:28,090
spread this information

2421
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:31,720
and create some rationality in
the world when it comes to Covid.

2422
02:33:31,990 --> 02:33:34,120
Thanks for being here
I'll see you in episode two.

2423
02:33:41,830 --> 02:33:45,670
There's something really wrong
with this. This is not about medicine.

2424
02:33:45,790 --> 02:33:50,380
This is not about trying to heal people.
This is about trying to control people

2425
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:52,090
and we want to see the science.

2426
02:33:52,450 --> 02:33:56,710
Literally, everyone at the Bill of Rights
with one exception, the second amendment,

2427
02:33:57,130 --> 02:34:01,840
has been trashed in the
dumpster this year, in one year.

2428
02:34:02,020 --> 02:34:07,180
It was all about how do you impose censorship,
how do you impose totalitarian control?

2429
02:34:07,300 --> 02:34:12,460
The term misinformation does
not actually mean it's factually wrong

2430
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:17,440
[...] it's a euphemism for any statement
that departs from official pronouncements

2431
02:34:17,710 --> 02:34:20,140
of the government or for
the pharmaceutical industry.

2432
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:22,900
There were excess
numbers of people

2433
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:26,950
dying after the vaccine that were being
reported to the vaccine adverse event

2434
02:34:26,950 --> 02:34:30,590
reporting system exceeding
the level of comfort.

2435
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:32,770
We can't get 50%
protection, it's a "no go"

2436
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:35,680
and if a vaccine can't last a
year, it's a "no-go", because

2437
02:34:35,781 --> 02:34:39,310
all we're going to do is just keep
creating a dependency on these boosters.

2438
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:44,170
A mutant strain which is already there is
going to find a vaccinated environment maybe

2439
02:34:44,170 --> 02:34:48,520
more ideal to flourish. So [for] those who
we want to protect the most with the vaccines

2440
02:34:48,520 --> 02:34:50,020
the vaccines are failing.
